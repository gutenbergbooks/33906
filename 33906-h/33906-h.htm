<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>This little book was written at the request of
the Ministry of Information in March of 1918;
it was only released for publication&mdash;in spite of
the need for haste in its compiling which had been
impressed on me, and with which I had complied&mdash;shortly
before Christmas. Hence it may seem
somewhat after the fair. But it appears to me
that people should still be told about the workers
of the war and what they did, even now when we
are all struggling back into our chiffons&mdash;perhaps
more now than ever. For we should not forget,
and how should we remember if we have never
known?</p>

<h2>THE<br />
SWORD OF DEBORAH</h2>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>A.B.C.</h3>


<p>This world of initials ... in which the members
of the British Expeditionary Force live and
move&mdash;it is a bewildering place for the outsider.
Particularly to one who, like the writer, has never
been able to think in initials, any more than in
dates or figures. The members of the B.E.F.&mdash;and
that at least is a set of letters that conveys
something to all of us&mdash;not only live amidst
initials, but are themselves embodied initials. To
them the string of letters they reel off is no meaningless
form, no mere abracadabra to impress the
supplicant, but each is a living thing, coloured, definitely
patterned, standing for something in flesh
and blood, or stone and mortar; something concrete
and present to the mind's eye at the mere mention.</p>

<p>Just as, to anyone who does not know New
York, it seems as though all the streets must sound
exactly alike, being merely numbered, while, to
anyone who knows them, the words East Sixty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
First, say, are as distinct from East Twenty First,
distinct with a whole vivid personality of their
own, as Half Moon Street from Threadneedle
Street&mdash;so, to the initiate in the game, the letters
so lightly rattled off to designate this or that
official or institution stand for vivid, real, colourable
things.</p>

<p>But at first one is reminded forcibly of that
scene in "Anna Karenina" where Levin proposes
to Kitty for the second time by means of writing
in chalk on a table the letters "W, y, t, m, i, c, n,
b, d, t, m, n, o, t," and Kitty, with great intelligence,
guesses that they mean "When you told me
it could never be, did that mean never, or then?"
Kitty, if you remember, replies in initials at almost
equal length, and Levin displays an intelligence
equal to hers. I had always found that scene
hard of credence, but I have come to the conclusion
that Levin and Kitty would have been
invaluable at H.Q.B.R.C.S., A.P.O. 3, B.E.F.</p>

<p>And the fog of initials is symbolic in a double
manner; for not only do the initials stand for what
they represent to those who know, but in their
very lack of meaning for those who do not, they
typify with a peculiar aptness the fact that after
all we at home in England, particularly we ladies
of England who live at home in ease, know very
little indeed of even what the letters B.E.F. stand
for. We have hazy ideas on the subject. Vaguely
we know, for instance, that there are women, lots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of women, working out in France, though quite
at what, beyond nursing, we don't seem to know.
Motor drivers ... of course, yes, we have heard
of them. There is a vague impression that they
are having the time of their lives, probably being
quite useful too ... but of the technique of the
thing, so to speak, what do we know? About as
much as we know when we first hear the clouds of
initials rattling like shrapnel about our heads if
we go over to France.</p>

<p>And if we at home know so little, how can
other countries know, who have no inner working
knowledge of English temperaments and training
to go upon as a rough guide to at least the probable
trend of things? How can we expect them
to know? And yet knowledge of what every section
of the working community is doing was never
so vital as at the present moment, because never
before has so much of the world been working
together on the same job&mdash;and the biggest job in
history.</p>

<p>It is always a good thing to know what other
folk are doing, even when they are not your sort,
and what they are doing does not affect you, because
it teaches proportion and widens vision&mdash;how
much more important, then, when what they
are doing is what you are doing too, or what you
may yet come to do?</p>

<p>Gentle reader&mdash;and even more especially ungentle
reader&mdash;if in these pages I occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
ask you to listen to my own personal confession
both of faith and of unfaith&mdash;please realise that
it is not because I imagine there is any particular
interest in my way of seeing things, but simply
because it is only so that I can make you see them
too. You are looking through my window, that
is all, and it is not even a window that I opened
for myself, but that had to be opened for me. If
you will realise that I went and saw all I did see,
not as myself, but as you, it will give you the
idea I am wishful to convey to you. Anything
I feel is only valuable because my feeling of it
may mean your feeling of it too. Therefore,
when you read "I" in these pages, don't say
"Here's this person talking of herself again ..."
say "Here am I, myself. This person only saw
these things so that I should see them."</p>

<p>If you don't it will be nine-tenths my fault and
one-tenth your own.</p>

<p>Just as all the apparently endless combinations
of initials in France are symbols of living realities
to those who understand them, and of their ignorance
to those who don't just as the very heading
of "A.B.C." which I have given this chapter
typifies both those combinations of initials and the
fact that you and I are beginning at the very
beginning&mdash;for no one could have been more
blankly ignorant than I when I went over to
France&mdash;so the letter "I" whenever it occurs in
this book is a symbol for You.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE FEVER CHART OF WAR</h3>


<p>"The women are splendid...." How tired
we are of hearing that, so tired that we begin to
doubt it, and the least hostile emotion that it
evokes is the sense that after all the men are so
much more splendid, so far beyond praise, that
the less one says of anyone else the better. That
sentence is dead, let us hope, fallen into the same
limbo as "Business as Usual" and the rest of the
early war-gags, but the prejudices it aroused, the
feeling of boredom, have not all died with it.
Words have at least this in common with men,
that the evil that they do lives after them.</p>

<p>Let me admit that when those in authority sent
for me to go to France and see what certain sections
of the women there were doing, I didn't
want to go. I told them rather ungraciously that
if they wanted the "sunny-haired-lassies-in-khaki-touch"
they had better send somebody else. I am
not, and never have been, a feminist or any other
sort of an 'ist, never having been able to divide
humanity into two different classes labelled "men"
and "women." Also, to tell the truth, the idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
going so far behind the lines did not appeal.
For this there is the excuse that in England one
grows so sick of the people who talk of "going to
the Front" when they mean going to some safe
château as a base for a personally conducted tour,
or&mdash;Conscientious objectors are the worst sinners
in this latter class&mdash;when they are going to sit
at canteens or paint huts a hundred miles or so
behind the last line of trenches. The reaction
from this sort of thing is very apt to make one
say: "Oh, France? There's no more in being
in France behind the lines than in working in England."
A point of view in which I was utterly
and completely wrong. There is a great deal of
difference, not in any increased danger, but in
quite other ways, as I shall show in the place and
order in which it was gradually made apparent
to me.</p>

<p>Also, no one who has not been at the war knows
the hideous boredom of it ... a boredom that
the soul dreads like a fatal miasma. And if I had
felt it in Belgium in those terrible grey first weeks
of her pain, when at least one was in the midst of
war, as it was then, still fluid and mobile, still full
of alarums and excursions, with all the suffering
and death immediately under one's eyes still a new
thing; if I had felt it again, even more strongly,
when I went right up to the very back of the
front in the French war zone for the Croix Rouge,
in those poor little hospitals where the stretchers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
are always ready in the wards to hustle the
wounded away, and where, in devastated land only
lately vacated by the Germans, I sat and ate with
peasants who were painfully and sadly beginning
to return to their ruined homes and cultivate again
a soil that might have been expected to redden the
ploughshare, how much the more then might I
dread it, caught in the web of Lines of Communication....
I feared that boredom.</p>

<p>And there was another reason, both for my disinclination
and my lack of interest. We in England
grew so tired, in the early days of the war,
of the fancy uniforms that burst out upon women.
Every other girl one met had an attack of khaki-itis,
was spotted as the pard with badges and
striped as the zebra. Almost simultaneously with
this eruption came, for the other section of the
feminine community, reaction from it. We others
became rather self-consciously proud of our femininity,
of being "fluffy"&mdash;in much the same way
that anti-suffragists used to be fluffy when they
said they preferred to influence a man's vote, and
that they thought more was done by charm....</p>

<p>With official recognition of bodies such as the
V.A.D.'s and the even more epoch-making official
founding of the W.A.A.C.'s, the point of view
of the un-uniformed changed. The thing was no
longer a game at which women were making silly
asses of themselves and pretending to be men; it
had become regular, ordered, disciplined and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
worthy of respect. In short, uniform was no
longer fancy dress.</p>

<p>But the feeling of boredom that had been engendered
stayed on, as these things do. It is yet
to be found, partly because there still are women
who have their photographs taken in a new uniform
every week, but more because of our ignorance
as to what the real workers are doing. And
like most ignorant people, I was happy in my
ignorance.</p>

<p>Well, I went, and am most thankful for my
prejudice, my disinclination, my prevision of boredom.
For without all those, what would my conversion
be worth? Who, already convinced of
religion, is amazed at attaining salvation? It is
to the mocker that the miracle is a miracle, and
no mere expected sequence of nature, divine or
human.</p>

<p>I was often depressed, the wherefore of which
you will see, but bored, never. Thrilled, ashamed
for oneself that one does so little&mdash;admiring, critical,
amused, depressed, elated, all this gamut
and its gradations were touched, but the string of
boredom, never. And the only thing that worries
anyone sent on such a quest as mine, and with
the inevitable message to deliver at the end of
it, is that terrible feeling that no matter how
really one feels enthusiasm, how genuine one's
conversion, there will always be the murmur of&mdash;"Oh,
yes.... Of course she has to say all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
... it's all part of the propaganda. She was
sent to do it and she has to do it, whether she
really believes in it or not...."</p>

<p>What can one say? I can only tell you, O Superior
Person, that no matter what I had been
sent to do and told to write I not only wouldn't
but couldn't have, unless I meant it. I can only
tell you so, I can't make you believe it. But let
me also assure you that I too am&mdash;or shall I say
was?&mdash;Superior, that I too have laughed the
laugh of sophistication at enthusiasm, that I too
know enough to consider vehemence amusing and
strenuous effort ill-bred, that doubtless I shall do
so again. But there is one thing that seems to me
more ill-bred, and that is lack of appreciation of
those who are doing better than oneself.</p>

<p>Lest you should misunderstand me when I say
that I didn't want to go to France this time, and
feared boredom, and felt no particular interest
in the work of the women over there, let me add
that I was careful to sponge my mind free of all
preconceived notions, either for or against, when
once it was settled that I should go. I went without
enthusiasm, it is true, but at least I went with
a mind rigorously swept and garnished, so that
there might enter into it visitants of either kind,
angelic or otherwise.</p>

<p>For this has always seemed to me in common
honesty a necessary part of equipment to anyone
going on a special mission, charged with finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
out things as they are&mdash;to be free not only of
prejudice against, but predisposition for; and just
as a juryman, when he is empanelled, should try
and sweep his mind bare of everything he has
heard about the case before, so should the Special
Missioner&mdash;to coin a most horrible phrase&mdash;make
his mind at once blank and sensitised, like
a photographic plate, for events to strike as truly
as they may, with as little help or hindrance from
former knowledge as possible.</p>

<p>Human nature being what it is, it is probably
almost impossible for the original attitude to be
completely erased, however conscientious one is,
and that is why I am glad that my former attitude
was, if not inimical, at least very unenthusiastic,
so that I am clear of the charge of seeing
things as I or the authorities might have wished
me to see them.</p>

<p>And, for the first few days, as always when
the mind is plunged headlong into a new world,
though I saw facts, listened to them, was impressed,
very impressed, by their outward show,
it still remained outward show, the soul that informed
the whole evaded me, and for many days
I saw things that I only understood later in view
of subsequent knowledge, when I could look back
and see more clearly with the mind's eye what I
before had seen with the physical. Yet even
the first evening I saw something which, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
only dimly, showed me a hint of the spirit of the
whole.</p>

<p>I was at the Headquarters of the British Red
Cross&mdash;which is what the letters H.Q.B.R.C.S.
stand for&mdash;and I was being shown some very peculiar
and wonderful charts. They are secret
charts, the figures on which, if a man is shown
them, he must never disclose, and those figures,
when you read them, bring a contraction at once
of pity and of pride to the heart. For, on these
great charts, that are mapped out into squares
and look exactly like temperature charts at a hospital,
are drawn curves, like the curves that show
the fever of a patient. Up in jagged mountains,
down into merciful valleys, goes the line, and at
every point there is a number, and that number is
the number of the wounded who were brought
down from the trenches on such a day. Here, on
these charts, is a complete record, in curves, of the
rate of the war. Every peak is an offensive, every
valley a comparative lull.</p>

<p>Sheet after sheet, all with those carefully-drawn
numbered curves zigzagging across them, all showing
the very temperature of War....</p>

<p>With this difference&mdash;that on these sheets there
is no "normal." War is abnormal, and there is
not a point of these charts where, when the line
touches it, you can say&mdash;"It is well."</p>

<p>As I looked at these records I began to get a
different vision of that tract of country called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
"Lines of Communication" which I had come to
see. This, where War's very pulse was noted day
by day, was the stronghold of War himself. Here
he is nursed, rested, fed with food for the mouths
of flesh and blood, and food for the mouths of
iron; here, the whole time, night and day, as
ceaselessly as in the trenches, the work goes on,
the work of strengthening his hands, and so every
man and woman working for that end in "L. of
C." is fighting on our side most surely. Something
of the hugeness and the importance of it began
to show itself.</p>

<p>And, as regards that particular portion which I
had come out to see, I began to get a glimmering
of that also, when it was told me, that of those
thousands of wounded I saw marked on the charts,
a great proportion was convoyed entirely by
women. There are whole districts, such as the
Calais district, which includes many towns and
stations, where every ambulance running is driven
by a woman. Not only the fever rate of War is
shown on those charts, but just as to the seeing
eye, behind any temperature-chart in a hospital,
is the whole construction of the great scheme&mdash;doctors,
surgeons, nurses, food, drugs, money, devotion,
everything that finds its expression in that
simple sheet of paper filled in daily as a matter of
routine, so behind these charts of War's temperature
kept at H.Q. is the whole of the complex organisation
known as the British Red Cross. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
outstanding even amongst so much that is splendid
are certain bands of girls behind the lines, who,
not for a month or two, but year in, year out, during
nights and days when they have known no
rest, have they, also, had their fingers on the
pulse of war.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>BACKGROUNDS</h3>


<p>At H.Q.B.R.C.S. the D. of T. told me the
first things for me to see were the F.A.N.Y.'s
and the G.S.V.A.D.'s. That is the sort of sentence
that was shot at me on my first day. I have
told you what H.Q.B.R.C.S. means; the D. of T.
means Director of Transport; the F.A.N.Y. is the
First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, and the G.S.V.A.D.
is the General Service Voluntary Aid Detachment.
Now the V.A.D. I had heard of, and of its members,
always called V.A.D.'s, but G.S.V.A.D. was
something new to me. Yet the importance of
the distinction, I soon learned, was great.</p>

<p>Four sets of initials represented my chief objectives
in France, the F.A.N.Y.'s, the V.A.D.'s,
the G.S.V.A.D.'s, and the W.A.A.C.'s. Of these
the former are known as the Fannies, and the last
named as the Waacs, owing to the tendency of
the eye to make out of any possible combination
of letters a word that appeals to the ear. Of these
four bodies, the Fannies and the V.A.D.'s were
in existence before the war, being amongst those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
who listened to the voice of Lord Roberts crying
in the wilderness. They are all unpaid, voluntary
workers, and they rank officially as officers.
Among themselves, of course, they have their
own officers, but socially, so to speak, every Fanny
and V.A.D. is ranked with the officers of the
Army. But with the G.S.V.A.D.'s and the Waacs
it is not so. They are paid, and are to replace
men; G.S.V.A.D.'s work in motor convoys and at
the hospitals, as cooks, dispensers, clerks, etc.,
and the Waacs work for the combatant service.
Except for their officers, who rank with officers
of the Army, the members of these two bodies are
considered as privates.</p>

<p>And as both the Fannies and the Waacs go in
khaki, and both the V.A.D.'s and the G.S.V.A.D.'s
in dark blue, it will be seen that confusion is very
easy to the uninitiate. That is my only excuse
for perpetrating the worst blunder that has probably
ever been committed in France. Taken to
tea at a Fanny convoy I committed the unspeakable
sin of asking whether they were Waacs....</p>

<p>They were very kind to me about it, but when I
eventually grasped the system, I saw it was as
though I had asked a Brass Hat whether he belonged
to the Salvation Army. Yet when I told
the sad tale of my <i>gaffe</i> to the members of
a V.A.D. convoy, they only seemed to think it
must have been quite good for the Fannies ...
but somehow it wasn't equally good for them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
when I timidly asked whether they were
G.S.V.A.D.'s ... though they were also very
kind to me about it.</p>

<p>The D. of T. motored me over to the Fannies'
convoy, on a pale day of difficult sunlight. Is
there anywhere in the world, I wondered, more
depressing&mdash;more morbid&mdash;landscape, than that
round Calais? It weighs on the soul as a fog
upon the senses, and it seemed to me that only
people of such a tenacious gaiety as the French
or such an independence from environment as the
British could survive there for long. I have seen
country far flatter that was yet more wholesome,
and I loathe flat country. There is something in
the perpetual repetition of form in the country
round Calais, the endless sameness of its differences,
that is peculiarly oppressive. Pearly skies
blotted with paler clouds, endless rows of bare
poplars, like the skeletons of dead flames, yellowish
roads unwinding for ever, acres of unbroken
and sickly green, of new-turned earth of
an equally sad brown ... and over all the trail
of war, whose footprint is desolation. The occupation
even of an army of defence means camp
after camp; tin huts, wooden huts, zinc roofs;
hospitals; barbed wire; mud. And, amidst all
this, and the sudden reminders of more active
warfare in houses crumpled to a scatter of rubble
by a bomb, there are people working, year in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
year out, undismayed by the sordid litter of
it....</p>

<p>The saving of it all to the newcomer, though
even that must pall on anyone too accustomed, is
that, like Pater's Monna Lisa, upon this part of
France "the ends of the world are come" ...
(and who shall wonder if in consequence "her eyelids
are a little weary"?). Inscrutable Chinamen,
silent as shadows, flashing their sudden
smiles, even more mysterious than their immobility,
turned from their labour to watch the passing
of the car; Kaffirs from South Africa, each
with a white man's vote, voluntarily enlisted for
the Empire, swung along; vividly dark Portuguese,
clad in grey, came down to their rest camps; Belgians
trotted past with their little tassels bobbing
from their jaunty caps. And, in great droves
along the roads, or, sometimes, more solitary in
the fields, the German prisoners stood at gaze,
their English escort shepherding.</p>

<p>The first time my companion told me we were
coming on German prisoners, I shut my eyes, determined
to open them unprejudiced, with a vision
clear of all preconceptions; really, at the bottom
of my heart, expecting that I should find them extraordinarily
like anyone else.... But they were
not. They were all so like each other, that by
the time you had seen several hundreds you were
still wondering confusedly whether they were all
relations ... even my Western eye detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
more difference between the types of Chinamen
I met upon the road than in these Teutons. Of
course, the round brimless cap has something to
do with it, as has the close hair-crop, but when
all is said, how much of a type they are, how
amazingly so, as though they had all been bred
to one purpose through generations! The outstanding
ear, placed very low on the wide neck,
the great development of cheekbones and of the
jaw on a level with the ears, and then the sudden
narrowing at the short chin ... and the florid
bulkiness of them. A detachment of <i>poilus</i>
swung past in their horizon blue, and what a
different type was flashed up against that background
of square jowls, what a thin, nervous,
wiry type, all animation....</p>

<p>The Germans were so exactly like all the photographs
of prisoners one has seen in the daily
papers that it was quite satisfying; I remember
the same feeling of satisfaction when on first going
to New England I saw a frame house and an old
man with a goatee beard driving a spider-wheeled
buggy, exactly like an illustration out of
<i>Harper's</i>....</p>

<p>All of which&mdash;with the exception of the old
man out of <i>Harper's</i>&mdash;is not as irrelevant as it
may appear, in fact, is not irrelevant at all, for
it is these things, this landscape, these varied races,
this whole atmosphere, which goes to make life's
background for everyone quartered hereabouts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and it is the background which, especially to memory
in after years, makes so great a part of the
whole.</p>

<p>As we went, remember, I still knew nothing
about the work I had come out to see or the lives
of those employed in it, I could only watch flashing
past me the outward setting of those lives, and
try, from the remarks of my companion, to build
up something else. Yet what I built up from him,
as what I had built up from the talk at my hotel
the night before, was more the attitude of the men
towards the women than the attitude of the women
towards their life, though it was none the less
interesting for that. And here I may as well
record, what I found at the beginning&mdash;and I saw
no reason to reverse my judgment later on&mdash;and
that was no trace of sex-jealousy in any department
whatsoever. I only met genuine unemotional,
level-headed admiration on the part of the
men towards the women working amongst them.
The D. of T. was no exception, and opined that
if the war hadn't done anything else, at least it
had killed that irritating masculine "gag" that
women couldn't work together. For that, after
all, will always be to some minds the surprise of
the thing&mdash;not that women can work with men,
but that they can work together.</p>

<p>"People talk a lot," he said reflectively, "about
what's to happen after the war ... when it's all
over and there's nothing left but to go home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
What's going to happen to all these girls, how
will they settle down?"</p>

<p>"And how do you think...?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there'll be any trouble whether
they marry or not. They will have had their
adventure."</p>

<p>I looked at him and thought what a penetrating
remark that was. Later, in view of what I
came to think and be told, I wondered whether
it were true after all; later still came to what
seems to me the solution of it, or as much of a
solution as that can be which still leaves one with
an "I wonder...."</p>

<p>He told me tales of the Fannies who, being
now under the Red Cross, came directly under
his jurisdiction. He told me of a lonely outpost
at the beginning of the war where there was only
one surgeon and two Fannies, and how for twenty-four
hours they all three worked, "up to the knees
in blood," amputating, tying up, bandaging, without
rest or relief. How the whole of the work
of the convoying of wounded for the enormous
Calais district was done entirely by the girls, of
how, at this particular Fanny convoy to which
we were going, they were raided practically every
fine night, and that their camp was in about the
"unhealthiest spot," as regarded raids, in the district.
How during the last raid nine aerial torpedoes
fell around the camp, and exploded, and
one fell right in the middle and did not explode,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
or there would have been very little Fanny Convoy
left ... but how it made a hole seven feet
deep and weighed a hundred and ten pounds and
stood higher than a stock-size Fanny. And,
crowning touch of jubilation to the Convoy, of how
the French authorities had promised to present it
to them after it was cleaned out and rendered innocuous,
to their no small contentment. As well-earned
a trophy as ever decorated a mess-room....</p>

<p>He talked very like a nice father about to show
off his girls and back them against the world.</p>



<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>MY FIRST CONVOY</h3>


<p>We arrived on a great day for the Fannies&mdash;the
famous Aerial Torpedo had preceded us by
a bare hour. There it lay, on the floor of the
mess-room, reminding me, with its great steel
fins and long rounded nose, of a dead
shark. The Commandant showed it us with
pride, and every successive Fanny entering was
greeted with the two words&mdash;"It's come." The
D. of T. swore he would have it mounted on
a brass and mahogany stand with an engraved
plate to tell its history. Two strong Fannies
reared it up, for even empty its weight was noteworthy,
and it stood on its murderous nose with
its wicked fins, the solid steel of one of them bent
and crumpled like a sheet of paper, above my
head. A great trophy, and a hard-earned one.</p>

<p>This was the first camp I saw, and a very good
one as camps go. (I merely add that latter sentence
because personally I think any form of community
life the most terrible of hardships.) It is
rather pathetic to see how, in all the camps in
France, the girls have managed to get not only as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
individual but as feminine touches as possible. I
never saw a woman's office anywhere in France
that was not a mass of flowers; and window-boxes,
flower-beds, basins of bulbs, are cultivated everywhere.
Every office, too, though strictly businesslike,
has chintz curtains of lovely colours. You
can always tell a woman's office from a man's,
which is a good sign, and should hearten the pessimists
who cry that this doing of men's work will
de-feminise the women.</p>

<p>The Commandant at this Fannies' camp took
me into her office, and she and the D. of T.&mdash;who
chimed in whenever he thought she was not
saying enough in praise of his admired Fannies&mdash;told
me the rough outlines of the history of the
body since the beginning of the war. Though
now affiliated to the Red Cross, they were an
independent body before the war, and when hostilities
broke out were a mounted corps, with horse
ambulances. They offered themselves to the English
authorities, were refused, and came out to
the war-zone and worked for the Belgians for
fourteen months. They ran a hospital in Calais
staffed by themselves for nurses and with Belgian
doctors and orderlies. Then, in the beginning of
1916 they offered to drive motor ambulances and
thus release Red Cross men drivers, and now they
are running, with the exception of two ambulances
for Chinese, the whole of the Calais district,
and have released many A.S.C. men as well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
It is a big area, with many outlying camps where
there are detached units. As a rule, there is only
one girl to each ambulance, but in very lonely
spots the allowance is three girls to two cars. At
St. Omer the authorities at first objected to having
them, but now they have taken over the whole of
the Red Cross and A.S.C. ambulances there.</p>

<p>At this camp that I saw, they have no day or
night shifts, as there is not much night work
except during a push, when everyone works night
and day without more than a couple of hours'
sleep snatched with clothes on&mdash;indeed, I heard
of a convoy where for a fortnight the girls never
took off their clothes, but just kept on with fragmentary
rests. The other occasion when there is
night work is when there is a raid. As I have
said, the camp is in a peculiarly unhealthy spot
for bombs, and until just lately the girls had no
raid-shelter. Now one has been dug for them,
roofed with concrete and sandbags and earth,
which would stand anything short of a direct hit
from some such pleasant little missile as is now the
pride of the camp.</p>

<p>But at first, even when the raid-shelter was built,
there was no telephone extension to it from the
office, and therefore the Commandant had to stay
in the office with one other to take the telephone
calls, then had to cross the open, in full raid, and
going to the mouth of the shelter call out the
names of the girls whose turn it was to drive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
ambulances. She told it me as exemplifying the
spirit of the girls, that never once, through all
the noise and danger, did a girl falter, always
answered to her name and came coolly and unconcernedly
up the steps and went across to her car.
But it seemed to me that it was as good to sit
quietly in a matchboard office and await the messages,
to say nothing of taking them across that
danger zone. Now an order has gone forth that
the ambulances are not to start till the raid is over,
as they are too precious to be risked.</p>

<p>It is not a bad record, this continuous service of
the Fannies since the outbreak of war, is it?</p>

<p>For remember it is not work that can be taken
up and dropped. You sign on for six months at
a time, and only have two fortnights of leave in
the year. And the girls sign on, again and again;
they are nearly all veterans at it. And, comfortable
as the camp has been made&mdash;all the necessities
of life are provided by the War Office and
the "frills" by the Red Cross&mdash;and in spite of the
tiny separate cubicles&mdash;greatest blessing of all&mdash;decorated
to taste by the owner, in spite of everything
that can be done to make the girls happy
and keep them well&mdash;it is still a picnic. And a
picnic may be all very well for a week or even
a fortnight, but a picnic carried on over the years
is not at all the same thing....</p>

<p>Certainly they all seemed very happy, and are
all very well. Girls who go out rather delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
soon become strong in the hard open air life, and
there has not been a single case of strain from
working the heavy ambulances. The girls do all
cleaning and oiling of the cars themselves, and
all repairs with the exception of the very complicated
cases, for which they are allowed to call on
the help of two mechanics, but only after the request
has gone through those in authority.</p>

<p>The domestic staff, with the exception of one
Frenchwoman in the kitchen, is supplied by the
girls themselves, and on this subject of domestic
staffs in France I shall say more later. Their
food is Army rations, which are excellent, as I can
testify after straitened England&mdash;supplemented by
milk and fresh vegetables, while the Red Cross
gives the extras of life such as custard, cornflower,
etc.</p>

<p>When at tea I saw butter brought forth in a
lordly dish and was told to take as much as I
liked on hot toast, I felt it was a solemn moment.
There seemed a very care-free atmosphere about
the Fannies, and at this camp the Commandant
was known as "Boss," a respectful familiarity I
did not meet anywhere else. Some irreverent
soul had even inscribed it on the door of her
cubicle. The Fannies "break out," so to speak,
all over the place; even the bath-room is not sacred
to them. It is a pathetic sight, that bath-room
of the Fannies, more pathetic, I thought it, after
I had seen the rows of big baths in other camps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The Fannies have a limited and capricious water
supply, and their bath is so small as to remove
forcibly the temptation for one person to use it
all up. Perched on two stalks of stone stands
a long bath in miniature, long enough to sit in
with the knees up, but of no known human size.
Inscribed above it&mdash;(under a fresco in black and
white of cats in the moonlight)&mdash;are these touching
words: "Do not turn on the hot water when
the cold is off or the Boiler will Bust."</p>

<p>Everything I have been saying and describing
is external, I know, but you see I was still grasping
at externals, though underneath certain things
were beginning to worry me. But I couldn't bring
myself to voice anything I was wondering to these
splendid strangers; later, though I never was with
any one convoy more than a night, still I got the
feeling that seeing so many of them had made me
more familiar with the ones I happened to be with
at the time, and so I screwed myself up to the
point and was richly rewarded. But that, as Mr.
Kipling would say, is another story.</p>

<p>We drove away in the windy evening, past the
parked rows of great glossy ambulances, and I
bore with me chiefly an impression of gaiety, of
a set purpose, of a certain schoolgirlish humour
and that knack of making the best of everything
which community life engenders when it does not
do exactly the reverse; of long wooden huts that
might have been bare but were decked with pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
patterned chintzes, bookshelves, cushions;
and above all, I took an impression of a certain
quality that I can only describe as "stark" in the
girls, though that is too bleak a word for what I
mean. It is a sort of splendid austerity, that pervades
their look and their outlook, that spiritually
works itself out in this determined sticking at the
job, this avoidance of any emotion that interferes
with it, and in their bodies expresses itself in a
disregard for appearances that one would never
have thought to find in human woman. It leaves
you gasping. They come in, windblown, reddened,
hot with exertion, after recklessly abandoning
their hands to all the harsh treatment of a
car&mdash;the sacrifice of the hands is no small one,
and every girl driving a car makes it&mdash;they come
in, toss their caps down, brush their hair back
from their brow in the one gesture that no woman
has ever permitted to herself or liked in a lover&mdash;and
they don't mind.</p>

<p>It is amazing, that disregard for appearances,
but of course it is partly explained by the fact
that the natural tendency in young things would
be to accentuate anything of that kind once it was
discovered ... and for the rest&mdash;I really think
they are too intent on what they are doing and
care too little about themselves or what anyone
may be thinking of them. What a blessed freedom!...
This at last is what it is to be as free
as a man.</p>



<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>OUTPOSTS</h3>


<p>It is a matter of temperament whether community
life, with its enforced lack of individualism,
or the intense refraction engendered
by the fact of two people only living together in
a solitude, is the more trying. In the former
state one may hope to attain isolation from the
very superabundance of personalities all around,
but for the latter there is at least this to be said,
that if the two feel like leaving each other alone
there is no distraction of noise and presences.
Either is a test to persons who are sensitive about
their right to solitude, a greater one than to those
who mix happily with their fellow humans. Both
are to be found in their best expression among the
English girls in France. From the Fanny convoy
to a lonely rest station was a change that set me
thinking over the problem, a problem in which I
was a mere observer, but which all these girls
had solved each in her different way, doubtless,
but as far as I could tell, to the nicest hair-fine
edge of success.</p>

<p>My first rest station was in an out-of-the-way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
little place, bleak and treeless, and consisted of
a wooden hut built alongside the railway line. In
this hut lived the two V.A.D.'s who ran the show&mdash;which
means that they do the cooking for themselves
and for the trains which they supplied with
food, that they dispense medicines for the patients
who appear daily at sick parade, and give
first aid to accidents, change dressings if any cases
on a hospital train need it, feed stretcher-bearers
and ambulance drivers, whose hours often prevent
them getting back to billets for regular meals, take
in nurses who are either arriving or leaving by
a night train and would otherwise have nowhere
to go, and in their spare time&mdash;if you can imagine
them having any&mdash;grow their own vegetables, and
make bandages, pillows, and other supplies for the
troops. Just two girls, voluntary unpaid workers,
who are nurses, needle-women, doctors, chemists,
gardeners and general servants, and whose
work can never be done, or, when done, has to
begin at once all over again. No recreation except
what they find in books and themselves,
nowhere to go, and that perpetual silhouette of
railway trucks and the hard edge of station roof
out of the window, of shabby houses and their own
tiny yard at the back, the noise of shunting and
train whistling in their ears night and day, and
with it all&mdash;worst touch of the lot&mdash;to have to do
their own work for themselves.</p>

<p>To slave for others all day as long as you can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
come in and find things ready for you at night&mdash;your
hot cocoa in its cup and your hot-water bag&mdash;that
great consolation of the women members
of the B.E.F.&mdash;in your bed, is endurable. But
to come in and have no cocoa if you don't make
it yourself, no bag if you don't see to it&mdash;that is
a different affair, and that is where these two
girls seemed to me to touch a point that of necessity
the others I had seen did not. And now that
women are doing men's work it is to be supposed
they have found out the value of meals and no
longer look on an egg with one's tea as the greatest
height to which nourishment need rise, and
hence have honourably to set about cooking for
themselves&mdash;and there is no woman but will understand
the boredom of that&mdash;the rations that a
paternal army insists on showering upon them.
Under such circumstances to work is human, but
to eat divine.</p>

<p>As I stepped out of the car at the door, feeling
terribly impertinent at this rolling round in
luxury to gaze at the work of my betters, one of
the V.A.D.'s came to the door of the shanty to
greet us. She was a fair creature, with windblown
yellow hair and a smut which kindly accident had
placed exactly like an old-time patch upon the
curve of one flushed cheek. She was wrapped
in a big pinafore of butcher blue, and explained
that she was "cleaning up."</p>

<p>It all looked very clean to me, certainly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
little dispensary, the room into which you first
walked, was spotless, everything ranged ready for
Sick Parade, glass, white enamel, metal, shining
in the shaft of sunlight which came palely in at
the open doorway. To the left was the kitchen,
stone-floored, fitted with an English stove, to the
right the tiny slip of sitting-room from which
opened the two still narrower little bedrooms.
That was all.</p>

<p>This is the atmosphere in which the two girls
live, but, as usual, they have done everything that
is possible with it. Brilliant curtains, pictures,
rows of books&mdash;the rest stations keep up a sort of
circulating library, exchanging their books from
time to time amongst themselves by way of the
ambulance trains, which are thus supplied with a
library also&mdash;and charming pottery ranged along
the shelves. The rest stations rather make a
point of their pottery. It is their tradition always
to drink out of bowls instead of cups, and their
plates have the triumphant Gallic cock, in bravery
of prismatic plumage, striding across them.</p>

<p>After I had said good-bye to the golden girl
of the inspired smut, I went on to a bigger rest
station at a terminus and was in time to lunch
there. It was a more sophisticated affair than
that which I had left, yet when this rest station
was started, at the beginning of the war, its habitation
was a railway truck&mdash;for the romance of
which some of those who were there in that first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
rush, when you were never off your feet for
twenty-four hours at a time, sometimes sigh....</p>

<p>Now part of the station buildings has been partitioned
off for them, and there is a fairly big
dispensary, with a bed for dressings and accident
cases, of which quite a number are brought in, a
kitchen, a little dining-room where all the furniture
is home-made&mdash;deep chairs out of barrels and
the like&mdash;and behind that a big storeroom,
crammed from floor to ceiling with stores. The
girls do not sleep here, but in billets at the town,
but they have to provide meals at any hour and
meet all the ambulance trains with food and extra
comforts.</p>

<p>We had a very good lunch, of stew and onions
and potatoes, big bowls of steaming coffee, and
a pudding with raisins, all cooked by one of the
V.A.D. domestic staff, who always had to slip into
her place last to eat it, and get out of it first to
serve the next course. I saw only these two rest
stations, each typical in its way, the one of the
isolated and the other of the central kind, but they
are scattered up and down the line, varying in
character according to the needs of the particular
place.</p>

<p>At one, for instance, there is a small ward
attached, where slight cases, not bad enough to
be admitted to the hospital, and yet requiring some
attention, can be kept for a day or two, thus
possibly avoiding serious illness. Near to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
same one is a Labour Battalion, many of the men
from which are out-patients whose medical inspection
is held at the rest station. Near another is
a large convalescent camp, the O.C. of which
looks to the V.A.D.'s of the rest station for help
in various ways.</p>

<p>At them all there is always the work of feeding
the stretcher-bearers and ambulance drivers,
who in times of pressure have to spend many
hours at their work of unloading the trains without
any chance of getting a regular meal. In the
early days of the rest stations, when the ambulance
trains were often merely improvised, food
and dressings had to be provided for all the
wounded on board, but now, when the working of
the British Red Cross is as near perfection as
any human organisation well can be, the men have
every care taken of them on the perfectly-fitted
trains. Yet there is much attention given to the
sick and wounded of every nation who come in on
the trains, attention chiefly consisting of the giving
of extra comforts&mdash;cocoa, lemons, shirts, slippers,
cigarettes, cushions&mdash;and the re-dressing of
wounds, while a great deal as well as feeding them
is done for the staffs of the trains, for whom, besides
the lending library, an exchange of gramophone
records and of laundry has been arranged.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting thing to note about
the rest stations is that they are one of the few
points of contact between the members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
B.E.F. and the French population. Our camps,
our hospitals, our motor convoys, are all little
Englands in themselves, but every morning to
the sick parade of these rest stations come not
only the local V.A.D.'s and ambulance drivers,
but the French civilian population as well, and
in greater and greater numbers. Accidents are
brought to a rest station very often in preference
to being taken anywhere else, and anxious
mothers bring Jean or Marie when a mysterious
ailment shows itself in untoward spot or sneeze.
The Gallic cock is more than a decoration as he
strides across the pottery of the rest stations&mdash;he
is become a symbol as well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>WAACS: RUMOURS AND REALITIES</h3>


<p>When I spoke at H.Q. of the depression I
found in all the landscape around and of its peculiar
morbid quality, nearly everyone assured me
that I should find the country round E&mdash;&mdash;,
whither I was going, far more depressing. "There
is nothing but sand dunes and huts, miles of huts,
hospitals and camps and so on...." It did not
sound very delightful.</p>

<p>But to differing vision, differing effects, and
personally, I loved E&mdash;&mdash;; terrible as cities of
huts generally are, here they seemed to me to
have lost much of their terror. I loved the long
rippling lines of dunes, the decoration of hundreds
of tall pines that came partly against the
sandy pallor, partly against the vivid steely blue
of the river beyond, I loved the bare woods we
passed all along the road, the trees still not perceptibly
misted with buds but giving, with their
myriads of fine massed twigs, an effect of clouded
wine-colour. And was there ever such a countryside
for magpies? Superstition dies before
their numbers, helpless to count them, so far are
they beyond the range of sorrow, mirth, marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and birth, at any one glance. Everywhere
through those winey woods there went up the
fanlike flutter of black-and-white, the only positive
notes in all the delicate universe, compact
of pearly skies, dim purples of earth, and pale
irradiation of the sun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the roads there was the usual medley of
the races of the world, added to as we neared
E&mdash;&mdash; by Canadian nurses in streaming white
veils and uniforms of brilliant blue, and also&mdash;for
surely the most delightful of created blessings
may rank as a race of the world&mdash;by the
glossy golden war-dogs, who also have their
training camp near here, and take their walks
abroad, waving their plumy tails and jumping
up on their masters, like any leisured dog at home.</p>

<p>But&mdash;to my sorrow&mdash;I was not sent to look at
war-dogs, and so had to pass by and leave the
wagging plumes behind. I had several ends in
view at E&mdash;&mdash;; I had to see the large Waac camp
there, its outflung ramifications, and the work that
the Waacs did in the men's camps; and I had to
see the V.A.D. Motor Convoy, at which I was
to spend a night. Incidentally, I had high hopes
of getting permission to go out in an ambulance
with the latter, though it is against the most sacred
Army Orders for anyone not in uniform to be
seen upon an ambulance. Here I may say that
the permission was granted by a powerful individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
known as the D.D.M.S., though he mentioned
that being shot at dawn was the least painful
thing that ought to happen to me for doing it.</p>

<p>I was going first to the Waac headquarters, to
see the Area Controller, who corresponds to an
Area Commandant in the V.A.D.'s and whose
rank approximates to that of a Major. She is
supreme in her area and only the Chief Controller
of the Waacs is above her. Below her are
her Unit Administrators, who are in charge of
units and approximate to captains, and have their
Deputy and Assistant Administrators whom for
convenience' sake we can classify as lieutenants
and second lieutenants.</p>

<p>This is the place to say frankly that I had heard&mdash;as
had we all&mdash;"the rumors" that were flying
round about the Women's Army. They "weren't
a success," ... "it had been found to be unworkable ..."
and, as reason, a more specific
charge. Need I say what that specific charge
was? What is it that always jumps to the mind
of the average materialist? The most innocent
thing in the world&mdash;in itself&mdash;and the cause of
most of the scandal since the dawn of civilisation.
A Baby.</p>

<p>There is a certain type of mind which always
jumps to babies, apparently looking on them as
the Churchmen of the Middle Ages looked on
women&mdash;as the crowning touch of evil in an evil
world. If you remember, there was great agitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in certain quarters at the beginning of the
war, over "War-Babies." They were going to
inundate the country, they were going to be a very
serious proposition indeed. The Irish question,
Conscription, Conscientious Objectors, were going
to be as nothing to the matter of the War-Babies.
It is perhaps from some points of view a pity that
the War-Babies didn't materialize, but that of
course is another question altogether. "Passons
oultre," as the great Master of delicate&mdash;and
indelicate&mdash;situations used to say.</p>

<p>The point as regards the Women's Army is that
the whole of the agitation against it is a libel, and
one which decent people should be ashamed to circulate
even as supposititious. Quite apart from
the evidence of my own ears and eyes, at various
camps I was supplied with the official statistics for
the Women's Army from March of 1917 to February
of 1918. And of these women who "have
not been a success," as the mischievous gossip has
had it, how many do you think have proved failures
out of six thousand? In the time mentioned
fourteen have been sent home for incompetence,
without any slur on their characters; twenty-three
for lack of discipline, mostly in the early days
when the girls did not realise what being in the
Army meant and thought if they wanted to go to
any particular place there was no reason why
they shouldn't; and fifteen who were already
<i>enceinte</i> before leaving England and which even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the most censorious can hardly lay to the charge
of the B.E.F. And of all that six thousand what
percentage do you suppose has had to be sent back
for what is euphemistically known, I believe, as
"getting into trouble," since landing in France?
No percentage at all, if I may express myself thus
unmathematically, but exactly five cases. Five,
out of six thousand. Compare that with the
morality of any village in England, or anywhere
else in the world, and then say, if you dare to be
so obviously dishonest, that there is any reason
why the Women's Army should be aspersed.</p>

<p>These statistics were given to me at the office
of the Area Controller, and later repeated at the
Women's Army H.Q. by the Controller in Chief,
but on that first sunny morning amongst the pines
and pale golden sand-dunes it was naturally the
human and individual side rather than any of
figures, however startling, that claimed the mind
the most. For one thing, I had the actual organisation
and attributes of the Women's Army
to learn. I knew nothing. The actual working
knowledge, apart from impressions and things
learnt only by seeing them, that I gathered during
the days I spent at various Waac centres is
as follows:</p>

<p>The Women's Army differs from the F.A.N.Y.
and the V.A.D. in being a paid instead of a voluntary
body, in being directly under the Army, not
the Red Cross, and in its members being ranked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as privates. But it also differs from the G.S.V.A.D.,
though that too is paid and its members rank
as privates. The G.S.V.A.D. is far more
"mixed"; its members are of all classes and educations,
and are drafted off for work accordingly,
but the bulk of the Waacs are working girls and
do manual labour, such as gardening, cooking,
baking, scrubbing, etc., though there are amongst
them girls of a more specialised education who
are signallers and clerks. The officers, of course,
are women of education who have undergone a
stiff training and been carefully selected for the
posts they fill. For, as will be seen, nearly everything
depends upon the Waac officers; they have
certainly a greater power for good or harm than
the officers in the Regular Army, and never were
both the force and danger of personality more
acutely illustrated than in the position of the
Waac leaders.</p>

<p>A Unit Administrator has to know individually
every girl in her camp, though there may be several
hundreds. She has to blend with her absolute
authority a maternal interest and supervision.
While she has no power to say whom a girl shall
or shall not "walk out" with, she yet makes it her
business to know what choice of men friends the
girl makes and to influence, as far as she can, that
choice towards discretion. She must not nag but
must inculcate by subtle methods a realisation of
what is due to the uniform, a sense of the "idea,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the "symbol," of it. She does not actually say to
a girl that she is not to walk arm in arm with a
Tommy or pin her collar with her paste brooch,
but she conveys to her that these things are not
done in the best uniforms.... And the girl learns
with incredible rapidity. A thing is Not Done&mdash;what
a potency in those words; in that attitude
of mind! It probably influenced the earliest savages
in the manner of wearing their cowries.</p>

<p>After all, the whole idea of uniform, of distinguishing
one caste from another by bits of different
coloured cloth, is based on the instinct
for being superior. Was it not John Selden who
said something to the effect that our rulers have
always tried to make themselves as different from
us as possible? Of course they have, and it is exactly
the same thing which the wise Pope Gregory
VII had in mind when he definitely crystallised
the measures for celibacy of the priesthood, and
it is exactly the same thing which puts the policeman
into a dark blue uniform and a helmet before
he can so much as stop a milkcart. A policeman
in plain clothes is a dethroned monarch. Nothing
in the nature of controlling others was ever
done without dressing up. The marvel is that
for so many centuries the principle should have
been confined to the masculine sex, when it has
such an obvious appeal to the feminine.</p>

<p>This principle when carried a step further and
applied to those controlled, by giving them also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the sensation of being different from the rest of
the world, results in that spirit called <i>esprit de
corps</i>, which is really <i>esprit de l'uniforme</i>. Towards
the rest of the world the uniformed are
proud of being different, amongst themselves
proud of being alike, and the more alike, so to
speak, the aliker. It is not a thing to treat scornfully,
for it has the whole of symbolism behind
it. That which makes a man cheerfully die for
a piece of bunting which, prosaically speaking, <i>is</i>
only a piece of bunting that happens to be dyed
red, white, and blue, is part of this same spirit.
Dull of soul indeed must he be who can look without
a profound emotion on the tattered "colours"
of a regiment, and yet it is only the idea, the
symbol, that makes these things what they are....</p>

<p>And for most of these girls, remember, it is
the first time they have had a symbol held before
them.... We of the upper classes are brought
up with many reverences&mdash;for our superiors, our
elders, for traditions, but the classes which for
want of a better word I must call "lower"&mdash;so
please do not cavil at me for doing so or attribute
false meanings&mdash;are for the most part brought up
to think themselves as good as anyone else, and
their "rights" the chief thing in life; while owing
to the unfortunate curriculum of our Board
Schools, which does not insist nearly enough on
history as the fount of the present and of all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is great and good in the past, they are left without
those standards of impersonal enthusiasms and
imaginative daring&mdash;which should be the rightful
inheritance of us all.</p>

<p>These girls are now given an abstract idea to
live up to, no mere standard of expediency, but
an idea that appeals to the imagination. And how
magnificently they are responding those statistics
show, but more still does the attitude of all the
officers and men who have to do with them. I
talked with all ranks on the subject, and never
once did I meet with anything but admiration and
enthusiasm. The men are touchingly grateful to
them and value their work and their companionship.
For, very wisely, the girls are encouraged
to be friends with the men, are allowed to walk
out with them, to give teas and dances for them
in the Y.W.C.A. huts, and to go to return parties
given by the men in the Y.M.C.A. huts. It is,
of course, easy to sneer at the ideal which is held
before the men, of treating these girls as they
would their sisters, but the fact remains that they
very beautifully do so.</p>

<p>Another point to be remembered is, that, far
from these girls being exposed to undue temptation,
the great majority of them have never been
so well looked after as now. They are mostly
girls of a class that knows few restrictions, who,
with the exception of those previously in domestic
service, have always had what they call their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
"evenings," when they roamed the streets or went
to the cinemas with their "boys."</p>

<p>Now every Waac has to be in by eight, can go
nowhere without permission, is carefully though
unostentatiously shepherded, and is provided with
healthy recreation, such as Swedish exercises,
Morris dancing, hockey, and the like. In short,
she is now looked after and guarded as young
girls of the educated classes are normally.</p>

<p>And these are the girls, good, honest, hard-working
creatures, who have been maligned in
whispers and giggles up and down the country.
It is perhaps needless to say that they are naturally
very indignant over it, that the parents of
many write to them agitatedly to demand if it's
all true and to beg them to come back, and that
sometimes, when they are home on leave, instead
of their uniforms bringing them the respect and
honour they deserve and which every man overseas
accords to them, they are subjected to insult
from people who have nothing better to do than
to betray to the world the pitiable condition of
their own nasty minds.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE BROWN GRAVES</h3>


<p>When first one has dealings with the Waacs
and their officers, one imagines distractedly that
one has fallen among Royalty. This is
because the word "Ma'am" is always used by a
Waac when speaking to another of superior rank,
till you very nearly find yourself bobbing. Later
this impression is strengthened by the memory for
faces which every Waac officer displays in a manner
one has always been taught to consider truly
royal. It is only among themselves that any
titles exist; to the outside world, even the Army
officers, each Waac officer is mere "Mrs." or
"Miss," whichever she may chance to be. The
"putting on of frills" has been avoided with extraordinary
dexterity; there is just enough ritual
to make the girls feel they belong to an organised
body, without the enemy being given occasion to
blaspheme by saying that women like playing at
being men. In France, though not in England,
the girls salute their officers, as this helps them to
get at the "idea" of the thing&mdash;that feeling of
being part of an ordered whole, which is so valuable.</p>

<p>In the matter of uniforms, someone at the War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Office, or wherever these things are thought out,
has really had a rather charming series of inspirations.
At first the women wore the same badges
as denote the ranks of soldiers, but a paternal&mdash;or
should one not almost say maternal?&mdash;Government
evidently thought that not feminine enough,
and now the badges of varying rank are roses,
fleur-de-lys and laurel leaves, a touch which would
have delighted old Andrew Marvell.</p>

<p>One of the chief activities of the Waacs is cooking,
and when, escorted by the D.D.M.S., whom
I have before mentioned, I arrived at the little
wooden office amidst the pines, it was to hear a
one-sided conversation on the telephone between
the Area Controller and various great ones of the
earth who were frantically ringing up for cooks.
Also a new Officers' Club for senior officers wanting
a rest from the firing line is just being opened
near E&mdash;&mdash;, and it is to be staffed by Waacs and
the cook is to be of the very best. Punch's immortal
advice as to the treatment of husbands is
not forgotten by the Waac controllers when questions
of this kind arise.</p>

<p>After talk of cooks came the seeing of cooks, in
a big camp and Small Arms school near. Kitchens
are kitchens and mess-rooms mess-rooms
everywhere you go, and beyond a general impression
of extreme cleanliness, an extraordinarily appealing
smell of stew, and the sight of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
branches of mimosa set about the long mess tables,
there is nothing of particular interest to describe.
The point is that all the preparing and the serving
of food in this great camp for officers and
men is done by women and that all the male creatures
are unreservedly jubilant at the change.
The C.O. expressed his hope that after the war the
W.A.A.C. would continue as a permanent part of
the Army, while a sergeant gave it as his opinion
that the women managed to introduce so much
more variety into the preparation of the food than
the men had done. Also, he added that they
wasted much less.</p>

<p>In every kitchen there is a forewoman cook&mdash;there
are these forewomen in every department
of the work of the women, and they correspond
rather to the "noncoms" among the men. At
present they are distinguished by a bronze laurel
leaf and always have their own mess-room and
sitting-room as distinct from the rest of the girls,
but it is rather an influence than an authority which
is vested in them, though the advisability of definitely
endowing them with more of the latter is
being considered. They "answer," as the rest of
the Waac machinery does, extremely well.</p>

<p>An interesting point about army kitchens, as
they are run nowadays, is that after the amount
of fats necessary to the cooking has been put
aside, the rest is poured into great tins, graded
according to its quality, and sent home for munitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
We are getting things down to the fine
edge of no-waste at last, and the women are helping
to do it.</p>

<p>At another camp I found the C.O. most anxious
for the women to start a Mending Factory&mdash;it
would be such a help to the men, who, unlike sailors,
are not adept at the repairing of their clothes.
Also a laundry, he intimated, would be necessary
really to round off the scheme satisfactorily. Both
these are thoroughly sound suggestions that may
yet, let us hope, come to something, though they
would be in a sense breaking new ground, as the
idea of the Waacs is that they actually replace
men. Each cook releases one man, while among
the clerks at present the ratio is four women to
three men. And there are already six thousand
Waacs in France.... Does not this give the obvious
reason why slanders, started by enemy
agents, have been busy trying to drive the
Women's Army out of France?</p>

<p>Every Waac who goes to France is like the
pawn who attains the top of the chessboard and
is exchanged for a more valuable piece. She sends
a fighting man to his job by taking on the jobs that
are really a woman's after all. For is it not
woman's earliest job to look after man?</p>

<p>She looks after him to keep him well and strong,
she looks after him when he is ill&mdash;and now, in
France, she looks after the gallant dead, who are
lying in the soil for which they fought. Between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the pines and the gleaming river with its sandy
shoals are the rows of crosses, sparkling, the ash
grey wood of them, in the effulgence of the spring
light, making hundreds of points of brightness
above the earth still brown and bare, that soon,
under the gardeners' care, will blossom like the
rose. Not a desert even now&mdash;for no place where
fighters rest is a desert&mdash;but a place expectant,
full of the promise of beauty to come, an outward
beauty which is what it calls for as its right, because
it is holy ground. Not only in the merely
technical sense as the consecrated earth of quiet
English cemeteries, where lie all, both those who
lived well and those who lived basely, but holy
as a place can only be when it is held by those who
all died perfectly....</p>

<p>Here and there, among the earth-brown graves,
stooping above them, are the earth-brown figures
of the gardeners. Every grave is freshly raked,
moulded between wooden frames to a flat, high
surface where the flowers are to overflow, and
above every raised daïs of earth the bleached
wood of the cross spreads its arms, throwing a
shadow soft and blue like a dove's feather, a
shadow that curves over the mound and laps down
its edge lightly as a benison. On each cross is the
little white metal plate giving the name and regiment
of the man who lies beneath and the letters
R.I.P. Here and there is an ugly stiff wreath
of artificial immortelles beneath a glass frame, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
pathetic offering of those who came from England
to lay it there.</p>

<p>Sometimes a wreath fresh and green shows that
someone who loves the dead man has sent money
with a request that flowers shall be bought and
put upon his grave on the anniversary of his death.
Sometimes, when they come over from England,
these poor people break down and turn blindly,
as people will for comfort, to the nearest sympathy,
to the women gardeners who are showing
them the grave they came to see. And a sudden
note of that deep undercurrent which at times of
stress always turns the members of either sex to
their own sex for comfort sends the women mourners
to the arms of the women who are working
beside them. Sentiment, if you will&mdash;but a sentiment
that is stirred up from the deep and which
would scorn the apologies of the critical.</p>

<p>And what of the girls who work daily on that
sacred earth, who see before their eyes, bright in
the sun, inexpressibly grey and dauntless in the
rain, those serried rows of crosses, all so alike
and each standing for a different individuality, a
different heartbreak&mdash;Do you suppose that they
will ever again forget the aspect of those silent
witnesses to the splendour and the unselfishness
and the utter release from pettiness of the men
who lie there? This is what it is to make good
citizens, and that is what the members of the
Women's Army are doing daily. They are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
only doing great things for the men&mdash;but they
are making of themselves, come what conditions
may after the war, efficient, big-minded citizens
who will be able to meet with them.</p>



<hr /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>VIGNETTES</h3>


<p>The interesting thing about the various places
where Waacs are housed, which I saw, is that
no two of them were alike in atmosphere.
I had rather dreaded much seeing of camps, but,
as a matter of fact, though I saw two, they were
totally unlike each other, while the other three
places that I saw each had an aspect, a character,
unlike the others. One was a convalescent
home for Waacs, set amidst pine-trees, a house of
deep wide stairs, airy rooms, long cushioned
chairs, and flowers, where one might well be content
to be just-not-well for a long time; the others
were houses where those Waacs lived who were
not in camps.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Four jaunty châlets, chalk-white in the sun,
hung with painted galleries, face the rolling sand-dunes,
behind them the sea, a darker blue than
any of the shadows of land on such a high-keyed
day. They are little pleasure-villas, these châlets,
fancy erections for summer visitors, built in the
days when this little Plage was a resort for Parisians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
playing at rusticity. Delicious artificial useless-looking
creations, bearing apparently about
as much relation to a normal house as a boudoir-cap
does to a bowler. Yet they are charming as
only little French pleasure-villas can be, and to the
receptive mind it is their artificiality that makes
such a delightful note of&mdash;well, not decadence,
but dilettantism&mdash;in this rolling sandy place,
where only the hand of Nature is to be seen all
around, no town, no village even, impinging on
the curving skylines, the very road up to their
doors but a track in the sand.</p>

<p>In these villas live incongruous Waacs, their
khaki-clad forms swing up the wooden stairs to
the galleries, and lean from the windows, always
open their widest, night and day. Less incongruous
the stout boots and khaki inside, as, though
the chintzes are bright and gay, there is an aspect
of stern utility, combined with an austerity that
somehow suits the blank sandiness of the surroundings.
In each little scrubbed room are two
beds, each&mdash;for the Waacs live in true Army fashion&mdash;with
its dark grey blankets folded up at the
head of the bare mattress; in the sick bay alone
the beds are covered with bright blue counterpanes.
In the recreation room and the Forewomen's
Mess are easy chairs of wicker and
flowers and pictures. It is all done as charmingly
as it can be with a strict eye to suitability;
it is community life, of course, but brought as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
nearly as possible to that feeling of individuality
which makes a home with a small "h" instead of
with the dreaded capital.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This other house was as great a contrast to the
bare little châlets as it well could be. It also was
at a Plage, it too had been built for pleasure, but
for pleasure <i>de luxe</i>, not of simple bourgeois families.
The wide hall with its polished floor, its
great carved mantels, its dining-room with gleaming
woods and glossy table and sparkling glass,
its big lounge with tall windows, where the girls
dance and play the piano&mdash;all was as different
from the bleached scrubbed wood of the châlets as
it well could be. Yet the spirit informing the
whole was the same, the bedrooms as austere in
essence even if they boasted carved marble-topped
chests, and even here the Army had found things
to improve, such as the making of paths at the
back of the house of round tins sunk in the earth,
and steps of tin biscuit boxes, ingenious arrangements
to save getting your feet wet on a muddy
day as you go in and out on the endless errands
of domesticity. And, as I sat at lunch in the
gleaming dining-room, where the wood fire burned
on the wide stone hearth, I heard the girls practising
for a musical play they were shortly to
produce.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>A camp is, of course, a camp, but there is a certain
satisfaction in seeing how well even a necessary
evil can be done. Where all was excellent,
the chief thing that really thrilled me was the
bath-rooms. The Waacs' bath-rooms are the
envy and despair of the Army, who rage vainly
in small canvas tubs. The Engineers are by way
of spoiling the Waacs whenever possible, and bath-rooms,
electric bells, electric light and fancy paths
of tin, spring up before them. There are in every
Waac camp rows of bath-rooms containing each
its full-length bath, and besides that, each girl
has her own private wash-place, in a cubicle for
the purpose. For, as the Chief Controller said
to me, "After all, it does not matter the girls
having to sleep together in dormitories if each
has absolute privacy for washing, that is so much
more important." To which it is quite possible
to retort that there are those of us who would
not mind bathing in front of the whole world if
only we are allowed to sleep by ourselves. But
that is just a different point of view, and as a matter
of fact, for the class from which the greater
part of the Waacs are drawn, privacy in ablutions
ranks as a greater thing than privacy in slumber,
so the psychological instinct which planned the
camps is justified.</p>

<p>Besides the bath-rooms and the ablution cubicles,
there is in every camp one or more drying-rooms,
which are always heated, and where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
wet clothes of the girls, who of course have to
be out in all weathers, are hung to dry. Laundry,
kitchens, recreation rooms, mess-rooms, long Nissen
huts for sleeping, I went the round of them all,
and, while genuinely admiring them, admired
still more those who lived in them.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't like a Nissen hut nearly as
much as the ordinary straight-walled sort. I
know they are wonderfully easy to erect and to
move, but when it comes to trying to tack a picture
on those curved walls.... And the girls
depend so on their little bits of things, such as
pictures and photographs from home. You will
always see in every cubicle, above every bed in a
long hut, the girl's own private gallery, the <i>lares
and penates</i> which make of her, in her bed at
least, an individual. In a Nissen hut you have to
turn your head upside down to get a view of the
picture gallery at all, though it has its advantages
to the girl herself as she lies in bed and can
look at the faces of her parents, absolutely concave,
curving over her nose.</p>

<p>As I was leaving this camp I heard sounds of
music and the stamping of feet, and going to the
Y.W.C.A. hut the Unit Administrator and I
looked in. There, to a vigorously pounded piano,
an instructress from the Y.M.C.A. was teaching
a dozen or so girls Morris dancing. They
beamed at us from hot glowing faces, these mighty
daughters of the plough, and continued to foot it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
as merrily, if as heavily, as any Elizabethan villagers
dancing in their Sunday smocks around a
Maypole.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>One more camp I saw, on a later day, and
though it was a camp, yet it had that about it
which distinguished it from all others. For it was
built round about a hoary castle, grey with years
and lichen, from whose walls they say Anne
Boleyn looked down, standing beside her robust
and rufous lover on that honeymoon which was
almost all of happiness she was to know.</p>

<p>Now it is an Army School, and within its grey
walls and towers the officers are billeted and in
its great kitchens the Waacs cook for them and
do all the rest of the domestic work, waiting on
the officers' mess and the sergeants' mess, serving
at the canteen, doing all the cleaning, everything
that there is to be done for a whole army school
of hungry men down on a five-weeks' course, to
say nothing of all the work for themselves in their
camp at the castle's gates, and there are sixty-six
of them, not counting the three officers who are at
every Waac camp&mdash;the Unit Administrator, and
the Deputy and Assistant Administrators. It is
hard work, and endless work, and though every
Waac gets a few hours off every day, and though,
as you have seen, everything is done for their
healthy recreation that can be done, yet the life
is one of work and not of fun, and though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
girls flourish under it, we at home should not forget
that fact when we give them their due meed
of appreciation.</p>

<p>But, hard as the life is, it seemed to me that at
that camp which has the happiness to be at this
castle, its duress must be assuaged by the beauty
of what is always before the eyes. Buried in
woods it is, still bare when I saw them, but with
the greenish yellow buds of daffodils already beginning
to unfold in great clumps through the
purple-brown alleys, and with primroses making
drifts of honey-pallor and honey-sweetness beside
the slopes of ground ivy, while from beyond the
curving ramparts of the castle shows the steely-quiet
glimmer of a lake.</p>

<p>For war this castle was built, and war she now
sees once again, for the arts of war are taught
within her walls. And how Anne Boleyn's roving
eyes would have brightened at the sight of so much
youth, at the sound of so many spurs! Let us
hope her sore spirit can still find pleasure in wandering
again over the scenes where she once was
happy, and if she has kept enough of innocent
wantonness to love a straight man when she sees
one, ghost though she be, and if her nose turn up
ever so daintily at the clumsily-clad members of
her own sex, whose toils she would so little understand
... why, she is but a ghost, and the modern
mind must contrive to forgive her.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>These slight vignettes have all been of vision;
let me add one of a less pictorial nature. The
Unit Administrators, as I have said, have to act
not only as commanding officers, but very often
as mother-confessors as well. Parents write to
them about their daughters, would-be suitors write
to them for permission to marry their charges,
and amongst the letter-bag are often epistles that
are not without their unconscious humour. One
day a mother writes to point out that she and the
rest of the family are changing houses, and so may
Flossie please come home for a few days ...
another mentions that Gladys's letters of late
have been despondent, and please could she be
put to something else that will not depress her?
Then Gladys is had up in front of the Unit Administrator,
and perhaps turns out to be one of the
born whiners found everywhere, perhaps to be
merely suffering from a passing fit of what our
ancestresses would have called the megrims. If
her work is found to be really unfitted to her and
it is possible to give her a change, then it is done,
but as a rule that is seldom the case, as, rather
differently from what we used to hear was the
way in the Army, every Waac Controller finds
out what the girl is best at and what she likes
doing most, and then, as far as possible, arranges
her work accordingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps a letter comes from a Tommy in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Majesty's forces, and begins something like this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"I beg to ask your permission to marry
Miss D. Robinson, at present under your command...."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Unit Administrator writes back that
she will endeavour to arrange leave for the marriage;
and perhaps all goes well, or perhaps some
such lugubrious letter as this will follow:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p>"<i>Re</i> Miss D. Robinson, at present under your
command, take no notice of my former letter, as
Miss D. Robinson has broken off the engagement...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Human nature will be inhuman, in camps and
out of them, and because Miss D. Robinson is doing
a man's work is no reason why she should
shed the privileges of her sex.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>EVENING</h3>


<p>Grey rain was falling in straight thin lines
upon the landscape, suddenly changed from its
splendour of sun-bright sands and blue gleaming
river to a blotted greyness. The rain danced
over the trampled earth at the V.A.D. Motor
Convoy Camp, filling the hollows with wrinkled
water and making the great ambulances
shine darkly. It was not a pleasant evening, being
very cold withal, and snow fell amid the rain,
but the Commandant took me out in her car to
give me as comprehensive a view of E&mdash;&mdash; as
could be seen in the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>When I say E&mdash;&mdash; I don't mean the little
French fishing village, near which we did not go,
but the whole vast town of huts set up by the
B.E.F. For E&mdash;&mdash; is become a town of hospitals.
We swung round corners, down long intersecting
roads, about and about, and always there
were hospitals, long rows of hospitals, each a little
town in itself. I was reminded of nothing so
much as the great temporary townships in the
Canal Zone at Panama. There is just the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
look of permanence combined with the feeling
of it all being but temporary, while materially
there is an air about board and tin buildings which
is the same the world over. I almost expected to
see a negro slouch along with his tools slung on
his back, or to catch sight of the dark film of a
mosquito-proof screen over doors and windows.</p>

<p>And the Motor Convoy do all of the ambulance
work of the whole big district, which spreads considerably
beyond even this great hospital town.
There are about one hundred and thirty members
in the camp and about eighty of the big Buick
ambulances. Unlike the Fanny convoy I had
seen, there are at E&mdash;&mdash; always day and night
shifts, a girl being on night duty for one fortnight
and on day duty for the next, except in times
of stress, when everyone works day and night too.</p>

<p>We came in from our drive in the dark and I
was shown to the room I was to have for as much
of the night as there would be, considering I was
going out on a convoy at one o'clock. It belonged
to a V.A.D. at the moment home on leave, but
she had left a nice selection of bed-books behind
her, for which I was grateful, and there was a
little electric reading lamp perched on the shelf
above the bed. It was a tiny place, but it was
all to myself.</p>

<p>At supper in the mess-room, with Mr. Leps, the
Great Dane, lying by the stove and the cat curled
between his outflung paws, we were waited on by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a very pretty V.A.D. with dark eyes and a deeply
moulded face compact of soft curves and pallor.
Afterwards, the Commandant, a few of the girls,
and I went into her room, which was a trifle larger
than the ordinary run, and could be called a sitting-room
at one end, for coffee and cigarettes.
There was a concert on, and I was asked whether
I would like to go to it, and, at the risk of seeming
ungracious, I said if they didn't mind I would
rather not. They said that they would rather not,
too. I had seen the camp before dinner, had
marvelled again how people ever got used to living
in match-boxes and having to cross a strip
of out-of-doors world to meals, and I was only
wanting to sit still, and&mdash;if the Fates were kind&mdash;listen.</p>

<p>For all the time, as during the preceding days,
I had felt the depression growing over me, the
terror of this communal life which took all you
had and left you&mdash;what? What corner of the
soul is any refuge when solitude cannot be yours
in which to expand it? What vagrant impulse can
be cherished when liberty is not yours to indulge
it?</p>

<p>These girls, these strong, clear-eyed creatures
whom I had seen, day after day, who had at first
impressed me only with their youth, their school-girl
gaiety, their&mdash;<i>horribile dictu</i>&mdash;their "brightness"&mdash;was
it possible that this life should really
content them? I am not talking now, remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of Waacs, girls mostly of the working class, or of
those used to the sedentary occupation of clerkships,
to whom this life is the biggest freedom, the
greatest adventure, they have known. I am talking
about girls of a class who, in the nature of
things, lived their own lives, before the war, did
the usual social round, went hither and thither
with no man to say them nay&mdash;except a father,
who doesn't count. Young <i>femmes du monde</i>,
there is no adequate English for it, sophisticated
human beings.</p>

<p>For women, even the apparently merely out-of-door
hunting games-playing women, have arrived
at a high state of sophistication; and this life
they now lead is a community life reduced to its
essentials. And a community life, though the
building up of it marked the first stages of civilisation,
is, to the perfected product of civilisation,
anathema. Individuals had to combine to make
the world, but now that it is made, all the instincts
of the most highly developed in it are towards
complete liberty as regards the amount of social
intercourse in which he or she wishes to indulge.
We have fought through thousands of years for
a state of society so civilised that it is safe to withdraw
from it and be alone without one's enemy
tracking one down and hitting one over the head
with an axe.</p>

<p>This right, fought for through the ascending
ages, these girls have deliberately forgone, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
every man in the Army has to forgo it also. Were
they aware of this? Or did they, after all, like
it, unthinkingly, without analysis?</p>

<p>I had wondered as I saw my previous convoys
and camps, and I had wondered again as I saw
over this convoy&mdash;saw the usual tiny cubicles,
with gay chintz curtains and photographs from
home, and the shelf of books, saw the great bare
mess-rooms, the sitting-room, bright with cushions,
cosy with screens and long chairs, saw the
admirable bath-rooms, with big enamelled baths
and an unlimited supply of hot water, saw the
two parks where the great ambulances were
ranged, shadowy and huge in the growing gloom
and thick downpour of rain. Everywhere smiling
faces, uplifted voices, quick steps&mdash;yet I wondered.</p>

<p>Was it possible this malaise of community life
never weighed on their souls? And, if possible&mdash;was
it good that it should be so?</p>

<p>I managed, stumblingly, to convey something of
my thought, of the depression which had been
eating at me&mdash;not, as I tried to explain, that I
didn't admire them all, Heaven knew, rather that
I must be, personally, such a weak-kneed, backboneless
creature to feel I couldn't, for any cause
on earth, have stood it. And I wanted&mdash;how I
wanted&mdash;to know how it was they did ...
whether they really and actually could like it...?
"Of course, I know," I ended apologetically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
"some people like a community life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They must be in love with it to like community
life carried to this extent, then," said one
swiftly, and a small, fair creature, with a ribbon
bound round her hair, agreed with her. She interested
me, that fair girl, because she was one
of those people who feel round for the right word
until they have found it, however long it takes;
impervious to cries of "Go on, get it off your
chest," she still sat quietly and wrestled until the
word came which exactly expressed the fine edge
of her meaning. She knew so well what she
wanted to say that she didn't want to say it any
differently.</p>

<p>They all talked, each throwing in a sentence to
the discussion now and again, but not one of them
grumbled. Yet they all showed plainly that it
was not a blind enjoyment&mdash;or, indeed, much enjoyment
at all&mdash;that they found in the life. They
were reasoning, critical, analytic, and extraordinarily
dispassionate.</p>

<p>I can't put that conversation down for two reasons,
the first being that one doesn't print the talk
of one's hostesses, and the second that it would
be too difficult to catch all those little half-uttered
sentences, those little alleys of argument that led
to understanding, but led elliptically, as is the way
of either sex when it is unencumbered by the necessity
of dotting its i's for the comprehension
of the other. But out of that hour emerged, shining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
several things which we in England ought to
realise better, and which lifted for me that cloud
of depression which had lowered over me all the
days in France.</p>

<p>These are not bouncing school-girls, "good fellows"
having the time of their lives, as vaguely
those in England consider them, they are, thank
goodness, finely-evolved human beings who no
more enjoy "brightness" than you or I would.
And it was the terrible feeling that everyone was
so "bright" which had oppressed me more than
anything else. The joy of finding that it wasn't
so, that what I had feared I should be forced to
take as the unreflecting school-girl humour of
overgrown school-girls was only a protective aspect,
that behind it the eyes of not only sane but
subtle young women looked out with amusement
and patience upon a world determined to see in
them, first and last, "brightness"!</p>

<p>Perhaps five per cent.&mdash;such was the estimate
flung out into the talk&mdash;of the girls really do enjoy
it, the ghastly, prolonged, cold-blooded picnic
of it, perhaps five per cent. really are having the
"time of their lives," but the rest of them have
moments when it hardly seems possible to stick
it. Yet they stick it, and stick it in good comradeship,
which is the greatest test of the lot. Their
salvation lies in the separate rooms&mdash;small, cold,
but a retreat from the octopus of community
life....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That concert which I had felt so apologetic not
to attend&mdash;what a relief it had been to them that I
didn't want to, didn't want to get "local colour"
and write of them as being so jolly, so gay! For
this again is typical&mdash;there are perhaps five girls
out of every hundred who enjoy being amused, to
whom it is all part of the life which they actually
love, but from the greater part goes up the cry,
"Work us as hard as you like, but for Heaven's
sake don't try and amuse us!"</p>

<p>For, of course, it takes differing temperaments
differently. To some community life is little short
of a nightmare, but to all there come moments
when it is exceedingly maddening. In those moments
your own room or a big hot bath are wonderful
ways of salvation.</p>

<p>As we talked, from A. came the theory that she
was only afraid it would prevent her ever loving
motors again; and she had always adored motors
as the chief pleasure of life, before they became
the chief business. B. could not agree to that.
C., who did agree, pointed out that it was on the
same principle as never wanting to go back to a
place, no matter how beautiful it was, if you had
been very unhappy there. Even after your unhappiness
was dead and buried it would always
spoil that place for you.... B. said "Yes" to
that, but argued that it would not spoil the beauty
of other places for you, which would be the equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of this life spoiling all motors for A., after
the war.</p>

<p>The flaws in the analogy were not pursued, for
D. advanced an interesting theory that the hardest
part of it was that you were so afraid of what
you might be missing all the time somewhere else.
She argued that the difficulty with her had always
been to make up her mind to any one course of
action, because it shut off all the others, and, like
so many of us, she wanted everything....</p>

<p>A. said that shilly-shalliers never got anywhere,
but I maintained with D. that it wasn't shilly-shallying,
which is another sort of thing altogether,
it was the passionate desire to get the most
out of life, to discover what was most worth
while. "I want to spend ten years in the heart of
China more than to do any one thing," I pointed
out, "but I sha'n't do it because when I came out
I shouldn't be young any more. Therefore the
ten years in China will have to go to a man, because
it doesn't matter so much to a man." This
life in the B.E.F. was D.'s ten years in China,
not because&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;it is going to last
ten actual years, or even that, as far as I could
see, it was ageing her at all, but simply because
while she was doing it she couldn't be doing anything
else. She had had to burn her boats.</p>

<p>Now that, to a certain temperament, means a
great deal, and it is one of the things, if not the
chief thing, that marks service in France off from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
equally hard work at home, and makes it, for reasons
outside the work, so much harder.</p>

<p>All natures are not the same as D.'s, of course.
To one girl a certain thing is the hardship, to another
a different thing. But the point is that the
hardship is there, not physical, but mental, and to
me it was the most exquisite discovery I could
have made in the whole of France. For the finer
the instrument, the more fine it is of it to perform
the work, and the more finely will that work,
in the long run, be done.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>NIGHT</h3>


<p>Not being among the lucky creatures who can
fall happily to sleep when they know they are to
be called at one o'clock, I lay in my tiny bed and
revelled in that wonderful story of "The Bridge
Builders" out of "The Day's Work," till the
sound of the storm without became the voice of
Mother Gunga. Then I turned out the light and
lay and listened to the truly fiendish train whistles
which no reading could have transmuted, and wondered
why it is that French engine drivers apparently
pay no attention to signals, but just go on
whistling till they are answered, like someone
who goes on ringing a bell till at length the door
is opened. The rain was turning to snow, so there
was less of that steady tinkling from without with
which running water fills the world. I lay and
listened; and the whistles and the bellying of the
chintz curtain and the occasional swish of a heavy
gust against the side of the hut were at last beginning
to blend in one blur in my mind when a
girl came softly into my room and whispered that
it was time to dress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>That utter quietness of the girls was a thing that
had impressed me after staying in hotels full of
the British Army, which goes to bed at midnight,
bangs its doors, throws its boots outside, shouts
from room to room, and begins the whole process,
reversed, at about six o'clock the next morning.
Here the girls wore soundless slippers, so
that those who had to be about should not disturb
those who slept, and doors were opened and shut
with a cotton-wool care which appealed to me, or
would have, if I hadn't had to get up.</p>

<p>When I was dressed I found my way down endless
blowy corridors, for the doors at the ends
are always kept open, to the room of the girl who
had called me. She looked at my fur coat and
said it would get spoilt. I replied with great truth
that it was past spoiling, but she took it off me,
whipped my cap from my head, and the girls
proceeded to dress me. They pulled a leather
cap with ear-pieces down on my head and stuffed
me into woolly jackets and wound my neck up in
a comforter and finished up with a huge leather
coat and a pair of fur gloves like bear's paws,
so that when all was done I couldn't bend and
had to be hoisted quite stiff up to the front of the
ambulance.</p>

<p>But first we all went into the kitchen, where
part of the domestic staff sits up all night to prepare
food for the night drivers. There we drank
the loveliest cocoa I ever met, the sort the spoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
would stand up in, piping hot, out of huge bowls.
Then my driver and the section leader for the
night led me across the soaking park to where,
in almost total darkness, girls were busy with
their ambulances. I was hoisted up beside my
driver and endeavoured clumsily with my bear's
paws to fasten the canvas flap back across the side
as I was bidden. I may say that I felt extraordinarily
clumsy amongst these girls, most of whom
could have put me in their pockets. They knew
so exactly what to do, their movements were all
so perfectly adjusted to their needs, they knew
where everything was, while I fumbled for steps
and hoped for the best.... They made me feel,
in the beautiful way they shepherded me, that I
was a silly useless female and that they were grave
chivalrous young men; they watched over me with
just that matter-of-fact care.</p>

<p>To me it was all wonderful, that experience.
To the girls, who do it every night, every alternate
fortnight, year in, year out, the thrill of it
has naturally gone long since; the wonder is that
to them all remains the pity of it. We swung out
of the park into the road. There was no moon,
the stars were mostly hidden by the heavy clouds,
the sleet blew in gusts against the wind screen.
We went at a good pace, bound for a Canadian
hospital, and then for a station beyond E&mdash;&mdash;,
where the train was waiting, for this was what
is called an "evacuation" that I was going to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
No train of wounded was due in that night, and
the Convoy's business was to take men who were
being sent elsewhere from the hospitals to the
train.</p>

<p>We stopped in front of a shadow hospital, set
in a town of shadow-huts, and a door opened to
show an oblong of orange light, and send a paler
shaft widening out into the night towards the sleek
side of our ambulance.</p>

<p>We heard the men being placed in the ambulance,
the word was given, and again we set off
through the night, this time so slowly, so carefully,
for we carried that which must not be jarred one
hair's breadth more than could be helped. We
crept along the roads, past the pines that showed
as patches of denser blackness against the sky,
past the sand-dunes that glimmered ghostly, past
the blots of shadow made by every shrub and tree-trunk,
and behind and before us crawled other
ambulances, laden even as we.</p>

<p>The station was wrapped in darkness, save for
a hanging light here and there, and an occasional
uncurtained window in the waiting train. We
drew up under a light, where a sergeant was waiting.</p>

<p>"Four from No. 7 Canadian," said my driver
crisply. The sergeant repeated, looked at a list
he carried and marked our cases off it duly, then
told us the number of the compartment where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
should stop. The ambulance slid on, very slowly,
beside the train and slowly came to rest.</p>

<p>I could see into the white-painted interior of
the train, could see the shelves running along its
sides, and on the shelves, making oblong shapes
of darkness against all the white, men laid
straightly ... in front of us the Red Cross orderlies
were sliding men down on stretchers from
the shelves of an ambulance, slipping them out,
carrying them up into the train and packing them
on the shelves like fragile and precious parcels.</p>

<p>And suddenly it seemed to me there was something
profoundly touching about the sight of a
man lying flat and helpless, shoved here and there,
in spite of all the care and kindness with which it
was accomplished. It is a thing wrong in essence,
it seems an outrage on Nature&mdash;I got an odd feeling
that there was something wrong and unnatural
about the mere posture of lying-down that I never
thought of before. The world seemed suddenly
to have become deformed, as a monster is deformed
who is born distorted. It shouldn't be
possible to slide men on to shelves like this....</p>

<p>The girl at the wheel pushed back the little
shutter set in the front of the ambulance and we
looked into the dimly-lit interior. I could see the
crowns of four heads, the jut of brow beyond
them, the upward peak of the feet under the grey
blankets, pale hands, one pair thin as a child's,
that lay limply along the edge of the stretchers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The orderlies came to the open door, one man
mounted within, and the top stretcher from one
side was slipped along its grooves and disappeared,
tilted into the night. The boy on the
top stretcher the other side turned his head languidly
and watched&mdash;I could see a pale cheek,
foreshortened from where I sat, a sweep of long
dark eyelashes, the curve of the drooping upper
lip. His turn came, and, passive, he too was slid
out, then the two men below were carried away
and up into the train. The ambulance was empty.</p>

<p>We turned in a circle over the muddy yard and
started off again, stopping again by the sergeant
to get our orders.</p>

<p>"Number 4," said the sergeant, and we swung,
once more at a good pace, along the heavy roads,
took fresh turnings about and about in the city
of hospital huts, and drew up at Number 4.</p>

<p>Again we were loaded, and again we crept back
along the roads where we had a few minutes before
gone so swiftly, meeting empty cars, keeping
in line behind those laden like ourselves. Again
we slowed down by the waiting sergeant to say,
"Two stretchers and two sitters from Four."
He echoed us, and we crept on to the appointed
carriage and stopped. So it went on through
a couple of hours, ambulance after ambulance
swiftly leaving the station, slowly coming back,
all drawing up gently by the train, each, opened,
making a faint square of light in the velvet darkness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
And then, at last, when it was all over, the
return, swift again, towards the camp.</p>

<p>We bumped along the road, the dim pines falling
away into the shadows behind, a very mild
funnel of light showing us a scrap of the way
before us and of hedge on either side, the twigs
of it perpetually springing out palely to die away
once more. The wind was behind us and the
screen clear; far ahead of us on the road was an
empty ambulance with its curtains drawn back,
bare but for its empty stretchers and dark blankets,
which made, in the pale glow of the white-painted
interior, a sinister Face&mdash;two hollow eyes
and a wide mouth&mdash;that fled through the night,
always keeping the same distance ahead, grimacing
at me, like an image of the Death's Head of
War.... I was glad when it swung round a
turning and was lost to us.</p>

<p>We drove into the unrelieved darkness of the
convoy park and drew up with precision in our
place, I wrestled again with the flap, and we got
out into the wet sleet, half-snow, half-rain. My
driver covered up the bonnet with tarpaulin,
turned off the lights, and we went across to the
kitchen. It was half-past three, and we were the
first to come back; we asked for bowls of soup
and stood sipping them and munching sandwiches
that lay ready cut in piles upon the table.</p>

<p>Then, one after another, the drivers entered
... pulling off their great gloves as they came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
stamping the snow from their boots. They stood
about, drinking from their steaming bowls, bright-eyed,
apparently untired, throwing little quick
scraps of talk to each other&mdash;about the slowness
of "St. John's" on this particular night, who hadn't
their cases ready and kept one or two ambulances
"simply ages"; or the engine trouble developed
by one car which still kept it out somewhere on
the road. And I stood and listened and watched
them, and I received an impression of extraordinary
beauty.</p>

<p>These girls, with their leather caps coming
down to their brows and over their ears, looked
like splendid young airmen, their clear, bold faces
coming out from between the leather flaps. They
were not pretty, they were touched with something
finer, some quality of radiance only increased by
their utter unconsciousness of it. Each girl, with
her clear face, her round, close head, her stamping
feet and strong, cold hands, seemed so intensely
alive within the dark globe of the night,
that her life was heightened to a point not earthly,
as though she were a visitant from the snows or
fields I had not seen, fields Olympian.... And
as each came swinging in&mdash;"<i>vera incessu patuit
dea</i>...."</p>

<p>I could have wished them there for ever, like
some sculptured frieze, so lovely was the rightness
and the inspiration of it.</p>

<p>But I went to my bed, and one of the goddesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
insisted on refilling my hot-water bag, though I
assured her it would be quite well as it was, and I
was unwound from my swaddling clothes and left
to dream.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>"AND THE BRIGHT EYES OF DANGER"</h3>


<p>Since the beginning of things women have been
mixed up in war, and it is only as the world has
become more civilised (if in view of the present
one can make that assertion) that their place in
it has been questioned. The whole question of
the civilian population has taken on a different
aspect since the outbreak of this war, owing to
the extraordinary and unprecedented penalties attached
to the civilian status by Germany, but the
sub-division labelled "Women" has perhaps undergone
more revision than any. It has undergone
so much revision, in fact, that women have, in
large masses, ceased to be civilians and are ranked
as the Army.</p>

<p>If it be frankly conceded that it is as natural for
women to want to get to the war as men, one
clears the way for profitable discussion without
wasting time while the outworn epithets of "unwomanly"
and "sensation-hunters" are flung
through the air to the great obscuring thereof.
The delight in danger for its own sake is common
to all human beings, to the young as an intoxicant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the old as a drug. It is not the least
of the tragedies of woman that this is a delight
in which she is so seldom able to indulge.</p>

<p>When the war broke, everyone wanted to go and
see what it was like, and it is merely useless to
observe that this was treating it as a huge picnic.
Before the tightening-up process began, in the
wonderful days when the war was still fluid, it
was possible to get out to the front&mdash;the real
front&mdash;on all sorts of excuses. The tightening-up
was necessary, and all too slow, but let us not,
because of that, fall into the error of calling the
instinct which urged non-combatants "mere" curiosity,
as though that were not the greatest of the
gifts of the gods, without which nothing is done.</p>

<p>Among these non-combatants who wanted to
see the war were many women, and if, mixed with
their patriotism and desire to help, went a streak
of that love of danger which is no disgrace to a
man&mdash;why, I maintain that it is no disgrace to a
woman either, but as natural an instinct as that
which drives one to a wayside orchard if one is
hungry.</p>

<p>There is nothing sooner slaked, for the time
being, than this inherent love of danger. Men
who wanted the fun of it at the beginning of the
war are heartily sick of it now, though they
wouldn't be out of it for worlds. But most of the
women haven't been allowed enough danger to get
sick of it, and so, in patches of young women you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
meet working in France, the old craving still lifts
its head. I came across a delightful streak of it
at T&mdash;&mdash;, the oldest big convoy in France.</p>

<p>The garage, over which the girls live, for their
camp is still a-building, is set in the eye of the
cold winter winds on the top of a hill overlooking
the sea. It was snowing heavily as I drove up,
great fat flakes of snow that wove and interwove
in the air in the way that only snowflakes can, so
that sometimes they look as though they were
falling upwards. The long line of the wooden
garage showed dark in the background, in the
space before it the ambulances stood about, but
the girls were fox-trotting in couples all about
them, their big rubber boots shuffling up little
clouds of snow; on the head of one girl was
swathed a greenish-blue handkerchief, which
made a lovely note of colour against the swirling
whiteness.</p>

<p>I was taken in through the garage, where two
drivers were painting their cars&mdash;for all painting
is done by the girls, sometimes with unexpected
effects, as on one car which I saw, where "Eve"
from the <i>Tatler</i> and her little dog were depicted
in front of the body&mdash;and up a flight of wooden
stairs with an out-of-doors landing on top, to
the cubicles, which opened off on either side of
the open-ended passage for the whole length of
the building. Here, in one of the little bedrooms
for two, we had a meal of cocoa and cake, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
as the "elevener," for the obvious reason that it
is consumed at eleven every morning. It was all
quite different from my evening at the convoy at
E&mdash;&mdash;, but equally stimulating.</p>

<p>The great plaint of the girls was that they
weren't allowed nearer the fighting line, and I
heard a story of how, in the early days, two cars
had managed to get right through to Poperinghe,
when that town was the centre of the Boche's attentions,
by the simple expedient of the girl-drivers
turning up their coat collars, pulling their
peaked caps well down over their eyes, and just
going ahead. They had a lovely time in Poperinghe
and lunched under shell-fire, and when the
military, including the Staff, were sitting in cellars,
the "Chaufferettes" sallied forth and bought picture
post-cards.</p>

<p>"It's a shame they won't let us go up to the
line now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," put in another very seriously, as
though she were adding the last uncontrovertible
proof to the perfidy of the authorities&mdash;"They
let the sisters get shelled, so why shouldn't they
let us?"</p>

<p>Isn't that a delightful spirit, and, I beg leave to
insist, a perfectly natural and proper one? Any
decent human being would like to be shelled&mdash;who
hasn't been shelled too much. It is like being in love&mdash;a
thing that ought to happen at least
once to everybody.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>One of my hostesses was a violinist and plays
at all the concerts for the wounded which take
place thereabouts. I asked her whether she didn't
find the work ruination to her fingers for the violin,
but all she said carelessly was that they had
been ruined for three years now, but it didn't
matter, as anyway she couldn't have practised
even if she had the time, since there were always
some girls trying to sleep.</p>

<p>And what do the local French people think of
these young girls in their midst, who work like
men and are out in all weathers and drive the
soldiers wounded in the great common cause?
They are quite charming to them, and indeed,
when they first came, the French met them at
every station with bouquets of flowers, so that the
girls, pleased and embarrassed, English fashion,
had a triumphal progress. But there are some
of the French neighbours who think the life must
be very hard on the poor things, and when, a little
while ago, the Convoy organised a paper chase,
the popular belief was that the hares were escaping
from the rigours of life.... When the panting
hares asked wayfaring traps for a lift, it was
refused them, as, though the kindly drivers had
every sympathy with the projected escape, they
were not going to assist them to defy authority!</p>

<p>The hardships which this Convoy had undergone
I did not hear about from them, but from
their Commandant. She told me of three weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
at the beginning of things, when there were no
fires, no hot water, except a little always simmering
for pouring into the radiators of the cars
when there came a night call&mdash;for the snow was
frozen on the ground all those three weeks and
the water in the jugs was ice. The girls didn't
talk about that because they were not interested
in it, but neither would they talk about one other
thing, though for a very different reason&mdash;and
that was of the time when, after the great German
gas attacks at Nieuport, they had to drive
the gassed men who came on the hospital trains....
You can't get them now to describe what
that was like, nor would you have tried, warned
by the sudden change of voice in which they even
mentioned it.</p>

<p>There was one point in which this Convoy
seemed to me to touch the extreme of abnegation
attained by the G.S.V.A.D.'s. I had seen much
earlier in my visit a G.S.V.A.D. Convoy, but have
not mentioned it because I saw it before I had
really grasped essentials, and it appeared to me
then just a plain Convoy, and as the bare facts
of it were not as spectacular as those relating to
the Fannies, I chose the latter to write about.</p>

<p>The G.S.V.A.D.'s, as I have said, rank as privates,
and among them are workers of every kind&mdash;scrubbers,
cooks, dispensers, clerks, motor drivers.
This G.S.V.A.D. convoy which I had seen
was made up of girls who had exchanged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
V.A.D. convoys, mostly from this very one at
T&mdash;&mdash; where I now was; and so they happened
to be all friends and all girls of gentle birth. But
when I saw their quarters&mdash;in a couple of tall
French houses that had been converted to the
purpose&mdash;I was very upset by the terrible fact that
the girls had to share bedrooms. In all the camps
I had seen since, both of Fannies and V.A.D.'s,
each girl had her own tiny room which she cherished
as her own soul&mdash;which, indeed, is what it
amounts to. And the Waac officers, of course,
have their own private rooms, though the girls
sleep in dormitories. This convoy at T&mdash;&mdash; was
the only voluntary one I had come across where
the inestimable privilege of solitude was missing,
though that will be put right when the new camp
is built.</p>

<p>And here I may mention that, deeply as I admire
all the girls who are working so splendidly
in France, I think perhaps my meed of admiration
brims highest for those members of the G.S.V.A.D.'s
who are gently born, for this very reason
of the sleeping accommodation. Let us be frank,
and admit that for the generality of working girls,
such as the Waacs and a large proportion of the
G.S.V.A.D.'s, it is not nearly so great a hardship
to sleep in dormitories as it is for girls who
have, as a matter of course, always been accustomed
to privacy. It is not so bad in the case
of members of a G.S. convoy such as that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
mentioned, where the girls are all friends, but
what of those ladies who live in the big camps
and sleep in long huts with other girls of every
class, all, doubtless, decent good girls, but, in the
nature of things, often girls with whom any ground
of meeting must be limited to the barest commonalities
of life? Also sometimes those in authority&mdash;those
who are and always were professionals,
not amateurs&mdash;have been known to use the power
given to them, by the inferior rating of these girls,
to make them rather miserable.</p>

<p>Personally, I have long had a theory, which
will doubtless bring down on me howls of rage
from those who will say I am decrying the most
noble of professions, that women are not meant
to be nurses. It brings out all that is worst in
them. The love of routine for its own sake, that
deadly snare to which women and Government
officials succumb so much more easily than do men,
is fostered in them. And so is the love of authority
for their own sakes, which is almost worse.
It has taken nothing less than this way to show
what splendid creatures nurses are under their
starched aprons. In times of peace only amateur
women should be nurses; for it may be observed
that the V.A.D. nurses, though they have had
long enough to do it in, have not developed the
subtle disease of nursitis. Evidently nursing is
a thing, like love-making, which should never become
a profession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>I was glad to have seen all the different convoys
I had, because no two had been to me alike,
and to each I am indebted for a differing expression
of the same vision, which is the vision splendid
of a duty undertaken gladly and sustained
with courage. From my first convoys&mdash;the Fannies
and the G.S.V.A.D.'s&mdash;I got the wonderful
facts of it, at the V.A.D. Convoy at E&mdash;&mdash; I
caught that side of it which I was most glad of
all to encounter, and at the V.A.D. Convoy at
T&mdash;&mdash; I found that delightful spirit of sheer joy
in danger which is too precious to be allowed to
die out of the world just because there happens
to be, at present, such a great deal too much danger
let loose upon it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>REST</h3>


<p>The snow danced in a fine white mist over the
ploughed fields, and drove perpetually against the
northerly sides of the tall bare tree-trunks that
lined the way for miles, hardly finding a hold upon
the smooth flanks of the planes, but sinking into
the rough-barked limes till they looked dappled
with their brown ridges and the white veining,
and oddly as though covered with the pelt of some
strange animal. High in the web of bare branches,
the clumps of mistletoe showed as filigree nests
for some race of fairy birds.</p>

<p>Gracious country this, for all the desolate whiteness;
it lay in great rolling slopes with drifts
of purplish elms in the folds, and on the levels
winding steel-dark streams along whose banks
the upward-springing willows burned an ardent
rust colour. And as the car rocked and bounded
along and the wind screen first starred in one
place, then in another, then fell out altogether,
one got a better and better view of it all.</p>

<p>What a wonderful people the French are for
agriculture.... Hardly a man did I see all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
days I motored about and about, but I saw mile
after mile of cultivated land, the sombrely-clad
women or boys guiding the slow ploughs, the
rough-coated horses pulling patiently&mdash;white
horses that looked pale against the bare earth,
but a dark yellow when the snow came to show up
the tarnishing that the service of man brings
upon beasts. Several times I saw English soldiers
ploughing, and rejoiced.</p>

<p>We came into the town that was our bourn
in the grey of the evening, passed the grey glimmer
of the river between its grey stone quays,
passed the grey miracle of the cathedral, and then,
in the rapidly deepening dusk, turned in through
great wrought iron gates into a grey courtyard.</p>

<p>It may have been gathered that, much as I admire
both their practical perfection and their spiritual
significance, I am no lover of camps, which
seem to me among all things man-created upon
God's earth about the most depressing. I had
lived and moved and had my being in camps it
seemed to me for countless ages, the edges of my
soul were frayed with camps. From the moment
of walking into the old house at R&mdash;&mdash; a wonderful
sense of rest that brooded over the place enveloped
me. The thing had an atmosphere, impossible
to exaggerate, though very difficult to
convey, but I shall never forget the miracle that
house was to me.</p>

<p>It was a Hostel for the Relations of Wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
and there are in France at present some half-dozen
of these houses, supported by the Joint War
Committee of the Red Cross and the Order of
St. John, and staffed by V.A.D.'s. At all of them
the relations of badly wounded are lodged and
fed free of charge, while cars meet them and also
convey them to and from the hospital. This
much I knew as plain facts, what I had not been
prepared for was the breath of exquisite pleasure
that emanated from this house.</p>

<p>The house was originally a butter market, and
the entrance room, set about with little tables
where the relations have their meals, has one side
entirely of glass; the lounge beyond, which is
for the staff, is glass-roofed, while that opening
on the right hand of the dining-place, the lounge
for the relations, has long windows all down the
side; so it will be seen that light and air are
abundant on the ground floor of the Hostel in
spite of the fact that it looks on to a courtyard.</p>

<p>From the relations' lounge, with its slim vermilion
pillars ringed about with seats like those
round tree-trunks, there goes up a curving staircase
of red tiles, with a carved baluster of oak
greyish with age, a griffon sitting upright upon
the newel. Up this staircase I was taken to my
room, and there the completion of peace came
upon me.</p>

<p>One could see at a glance it would be quiet,
beautifully quiet. Its window gave on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
sloping grey flanks of pointed roofs and showed
a filigree spire pricking the pale bubble of the
wintry sky, its walls were panelled from floor to
ceiling, its hangings were of white and vermilion,
its floor dark and polished, and on the wide stone
hearth burned a wood fire. And, to crown all,
after tiny huts, it was so big a room that the corners
were filled with gracious shadow; and the
firelight flickered up and down on the panelling
and glimmered in the polished floor and set the
shadows quivering. I lay back in a vermilion-painted
chair and felt steeped in the bath of restfulness
that the place was.</p>

<p>The whole house was very perfectly "got-up,"
the maximum of effect having been attained with
the minimum of expense, though not of labour;
it all having been achieved under the direction of
a former superintendent with a genius for decoration,
who is now V.A.D. Area Commandant and
still lives at the Hostel. The evening I arrived
there, she and the staff were busy stenciling a buff
bedspread with blue galleons in full sail, varied
by gulls. Everything is exceedingly simple, there
is no fussy detail, nothing to catch dirt. The
walls are all panelled, and painted either ivory
or dark brown; the furniture is of wicker and
plain wood, painted in gay colours&mdash;rich blues
and vermilion; the tablecloths are of red or blue
checks. In the spacious bedrooms are simple colour
schemes&mdash;in one there are thick, straight curtains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of flaming orange, in another of a deep blue,
in another of red and white checked material.
The floors are of polished wood or red tiles
strewn with rugs; vivid-coloured cushions lie in
the easy chairs; and set about in earthen jars are
great branches of mimosa and lilac from the
South, boughs of pussy-willow, the tender velvety
grey ovals blossoming into fragile yellow dust;
all along the sills are indoor window-boxes filled
with hyacinths of pink and white and a cold faint
blue.</p>

<p>On the walls the only decoration is that of posters,
and these create an extraordinary effect as of
a series of windows, opening upon different climes
and strange worlds, windows set in ivory walls.
Here is an old Norman castle, grey against a sky
of luminous yellow, there a stream in Brittany
which you can almost hear brawling past the
plane-trees with their freckled trunks, while beyond
it, through another window, you see a pergola
of roses whose deep red has turned wine-coloured
under the moonlight, and beyond that again, the
white cliffs of England go down into a peacock
sea. And, in the Red Cross dining-room, a poilu,
his mouth open on a yell of encouragement,
charges with uplifted hands, looking over his
shoulder at you with bright daring eyes, and you
do not need the inscription underneath of "<i>On
les aura!</i>" to guess what spirit urges him.</p>

<p>This, then, is the setting for one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
merciful of the works of the Red Cross. That it
is appreciated is shown by the fact that at Christmas,
at this house, with its staff of Superintendent,
cook, parlourmaid, housemaid and "tweeny," with
one chauffeuse, there were forty relations of
wounded staying. The average number of people
for whom Army and Red Cross rations are drawn
three times a week is twenty-five, but for these
rations as for fifteen are drawn, as the food supply
is too generously proportioned for a household
consisting so largely of women. But it will
be seen that with a constantly fluctuating population
the task of housekeeping is no easy one,
though it is tackled by the voluntary staff with
gaiety and courage.</p>

<p>They have troubles of their own, too, the
members of that staff, and in the big kitchen,
where among the dishes on the table a pink hyacinth
bloomed, the fair-haired cook I saw so busily
working was back from a leave in England that
was to have been her marriage-leave, had not her
fiancé been killed the day before he was to join
her. Now she is amongst her pots and pans again
and smiling still, as I can testify. The "tweeny,"
who also describes herself as a boot-boy, is a
young war-widow. Things like these are almost
beyond the admiration of mortals less severely
tested.</p>

<p>The material difficulties are not the worst in a
hostel of this kind, which in its very nature presupposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
grief. The relations, of course, are of
all kinds, after every pattern of humanity, and
each makes his or her emotional demand, if not
in active appeal to sympathy, yet in the strain that
it entails on the sensitively organised to see others
in sorrow&mdash;and unless you are sensitive you are
no good for work such as this. This hostel is
blessed in its Superintendent, an American V.A.D.
worker of a personality so <i>simpatica</i>&mdash;there is no
adequate English for what I mean&mdash;that you are
aware of it at first meeting with her; and she is a
woman of the world, which is not always the case
with women workers, however excellent.</p>

<p>Shortly before I came to the Hostel a very
young wife arrived to see her husband, who
lay desperately ill in one of the hospitals. When
he died she became as a thing distraught and
could not be left, and the Superintendent even
had to have her to sleep in her room with her all
the time she was there. Others, again, are aloof
in their sorrow, though it is none the less tragic
for that. The first question on the lips of the
Staff when the chauffeuse comes back from taking
the relatives to the hospital is, "Was it good
news?"</p>

<p>It was good news for the couple who arrived
on the same evening that I did, the mother and
father of a young officer who was very badly
injured. I saw them next morning in the lounge,
sitting quietly on either side of the centre-stove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a business man and his wife, as neat, he in his
serge suit, she in her satin blouse and carefully
folded lace and smooth grey hair, as if they had
not been travelling for a day and a night on end,
racked by anxiety, though you could see the deep
lines that the strain had left. He looked at me
with those patient eyes of the elderly which hold
the same unconscious pathos as those of animals,
and talked in a low quiet voice, and it seemed almost
an impertinence of a total stranger to assure
these gentle, dignified people of her gladness that
their only son was safe, yet how glad one is that
any one of these brief contacts in passing should
be of happiness! It is so impossible not to weep
with them that weep that it is a keen joy to be
able to rejoice with them that do rejoice.</p>

<p>"It's so free here ..." he told me, "that's
what the wife and I like so. No rules and regulations,
you can do just what you like as though
you were in your own home ... no feeling that
as you don't pay you've got to do what you're
told." And there was expressed the spirit of the
Hostel as I discovered it.</p>

<p>There are no rules, and it is always impressed
upon the Superintendents that the relations are
not obliged to go there, that they do so because
they choose to, and must be treated as honoured
guests. In the dining-room there are little tables
as at an hotel, so that the different parties can
keep to themselves if they prefer it; there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
times for going out or coming in, no times for
"lights out," no need to have a meal in if the
visitor mentions he is going out for it. The relations
who stay at these hostels are guests in every
sense of the word, and there is not one trace of
red tape or the faintest feeling of obligation about
the whole thing.</p>

<p>And that must have been what I had felt in the
very air of the place when I arrived, what stole
with so precious a balm over me who had been
in camp after camp, institution after institution.
This place, with its quiet walls and its grey shutters
wing-wide upon its grey walls, was not only
beautiful and rich with that richness only age can
give, it was instinct as well with freedom and with
peace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>GENERAL SERVANTS AND A GENERAL QUESTION</h3>


<p>I have left till the last what to some people
will be the dullest and what is certainly the least
spectacular of all the work done by the women
in France, but what is to me perhaps the most
wonderful and admirable of all. I mean that of
the Domestic Staffs.</p>

<p>For there is something thrilling about driving
wounded, something eternally picturesque about
nursing them, but there is no glamour about being
a general servant.... A general servant, year
in, year out, and with no wages at that, for I talk
of the voluntary staffs, girls of gentle birth and
breeding who deliberately undertake to wash
dishes and clean floors and empty slops day after
day. I think heroism can no higher go, and I
am not trying to be funny; I mean it.</p>

<p>All the voluntary camps I had seen, all the
hostels, the rest stations, and many hospitals, are
staffed by voluntary domestic help; and the girls
they wait upon, the drivers and secretaries and
such like, are eager in recognition of them. But
that seems to me about all the recognition they do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
get; they get no "snappy pars," no photographs
in the picture papers, no songs are sung of them,
no reward is theirs in the shape of medal or ribbon,
nothing but the sense of a dish properly
cleaned or rugs duly swept under. I consider
that there ought to be a special medal for girls
who have slaved as general servants during the
war, without a thrill of romance to support them;
a "Skivvy's Ribbon" as one of them laughingly
suggested to me when I propounded the idea.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the Headquarters of the
British Red Cross, at the Hotel Christol at Boulogne,
to which I returned on my homeward way,
as I had come to it on landing. The staff, counting
the Commissioner and officials, the clerks, typists,
secretaries, and Post Office girls, amount to
about a hundred and forty-five people, and the
house staff number seventeen and are all V.A.D.'s.
The Hotel Christol is also the headquarters for
all Red Cross people going on leave or arriving
therefrom via Boulogne, and all have to report
there; nearly all want a meal, many want a bed.</p>

<p>The men-workers and many of the women, such
as V.A.D. Commandants, etc., live out in billets
in the town, but the manageress and her assistant,
the Post Office Commandant, the girl driver of
the mail-car with her orderly (these two girls
drive about sixty miles daily with the mails), the
girls of the telephone exchange and the rest of
the Post Office girls, all "live in," and in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to the casual Red Cross workers who may appeal
for a bed any time there are the relations of
wounded who have been put up there whenever
possible, though now a hostel is being opened in
Boulogne for the purpose. All the people working
in the house and all Red Cross workers arriving
by boat are entitled to take their meals at the
Christol, as are all Red Cross workers in Boulogne,
both officers and privates, and the average
number of meals served is 2,500 a week. Four
or five girls act as waitresses in the dining-room,
and three are always in the pantry, which must
never be left for a moment during the day; so it
will be seen that the headquarters of the Red
Cross is a sort of hotel, except that nobody pays.</p>

<p>There are French servants to do the roughest
work, but the girls have plenty to do without that.
The house staff begin work at seven in the morning;
at seven-thirty in the evening they start to
turn out the forty-two offices, which they sweep
and dust every day. They wash all the tea-things
(not the dinner-things), and clean all the silver
and glass, they make the beds and do all the waiting.
A pretty good list of occupations, is it not,
carried out on such a huge scale?</p>

<p>The girls are well looked after, for it must not
be forgotten that some of them are not more than
eighteen, and their parents in England have a
right to demand that these children should be at
once guarded and cheered. No Red Cross girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is allowed out after half-past nine in a restaurant,
and none is ever allowed to dine out unaccompanied
by another girl. But when a friend of a girl
passes through Boulogne, then it is permitted that
she and another girl may go and dine with the
officer in question, always provided they are back
by nine-thirty. For superiors are merciful and
human creatures these days, and there is always
the thought that the girl may never see that friend
again. And Heaven&mdash;and the superior&mdash;knows
that these girls need and deserve a little relaxation
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>And would you not think that to girls who work
as these do and behave so well would at least be
given the understanding and respect of all of us
who do so much less? Yet how often one hears
careless remarks of censure or&mdash;worse&mdash;of belittlement.
That to other nations our ways may
need explaining is understandable, but we should
indeed be ashamed that any amongst ourselves
fail in comprehension.</p>

<p>What do the French think of our women?
That is a question that inevitably arises in the
mind of anyone who knows the differences in
French and English education. Let me show the
thing as I think it is, by means of a metaphor.</p>

<p>It is universally conceded that marriage is a
more difficult proposition than friendship, that it
is more a test of affection to live under one roof
and share the daily commonplaces of life than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it is to meet occasionally when one can make a
feast of the meeting. Yet this is not to say that
marriage is the less admirable state, but only to
allow that it is one requiring greater sacrifices,
greater tact, and&mdash;greater affection. Therefore,
when it is admitted that the presence in France for
nearly four years of English soldiers, English
civilians on war-work, and the consequent erection
of whole temporary townships for their accommodation,
is a greater test&mdash;if you will a greater
strain&mdash;for the Entente than if intercourse had
been limited to an occasional interchange of a
handful of people, one is not saying anything derogatory
either to French hosts or English guests,
but merely frankly conceding that more depth of
affection and understanding is necessary than
would otherwise have been the case. To superficial
relationships, superficial knowledge, but to
the big partnerships of life, complete understanding.
And, if that is never quite possible in this
world, at least let the corner where knowledge
cannot come be filled by tolerance.</p>

<p>England is no longer on terms of mere friendly
intercourse with France; the bond is deeper, more
indissoluble.... And as in marriage the closest
bond of all is the birth of children, so in this
pact of nations the greatest bond is the loss of
children&mdash;lost for the same cause upon the same
soil....</p>

<p>With a bond as deep as this&mdash;a bond always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
acknowledged and given its meed of recognition
by the most thoughtful brains and sensitive hearts&mdash;yet,
as in marriage, there are bound to be minor
irritations, points, not of meeting, but of conflict.
Trifles, indeed, these points, compared with
the magnitude of the bond which unites, but nevertheless
trifles which would be better adjusted than
ignored.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must recognise that though
the things which unite us, our common ideals, our
common needs, are far stronger than any difference
in our modes of thought, yet those differences
exist, and that, in marriage, it is often said
that it is the little things which count.... Heaven
forbid that we should so lose sense of proportion
as to say it when the matter in hand is the
marriage of nations, but nevertheless it is well not
entirely to forget it.... And, of all the differences
in customs between us, there is probably
none more marked than in our way of treating
what is known&mdash;loosely and with considerable
banality&mdash;as the "sex-problem." This is not the
place to discuss those differences, though, as one
who has known and loved France all her life, I
may mention that, personally, I see much to admire
in the French system and could wish that
we emulated it, but that is neither here nor there
at the moment.</p>

<p>France has probably evolved for the happiness
and welfare of her womenkind the sort of life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
which suits best with their temperament and circumstances.
Women, like water, find their own
level, and no one who knows France, and knows
the devotion, the business capacity, and the good
works of her women, imagines them to be the butterfly
creatures that English fancy used to paint
them twenty or thirty years ago. As a matter of
fact, the present writer had occasion, two winters
ago, to make a close study of the varied scope of
women's work in France&mdash;the hospitals for training
of <i>femmes du monde</i>, the schools like Le
Foyer, for the training of young girls of the upper
classes to help their poorer sisters, etc., etc., all
works carried on unostentatiously long before the
war broke upon us and proved their usefulness.
The "butterfly" Frenchwoman underwent, before
the war, a far more serious social training than
did the happy-go-lucky English girl, and was better
equipped in consequence, with a knowledge of
economic conditions, than the untrained Englishwoman
could be.</p>

<p>But we too have our quality, and I rather think
it is to be found in the greater freedom which we
are allowed. We were not so well trained, but
freedom stepped into the place of custom, and
gave the necessary attitude of mind&mdash;that unprejudiced,
untrammelled attitude which is essential
to the quick grasping of a fresh <i>métier</i>. That is
where our method&mdash;or, if you prefer it, our lack
of method&mdash;helped us, even as their training<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
helped the French. And the French, with their
extraordinary facility of vision, do, I think, understand
that we have simply pushed our freedom
to its logical and legitimate outcome, that we could
not be expected, after being accustomed, for many
years past, to be on terms of simple easy friendship
with men as with our own sex, above all, after
working side by side with them since this war began,
we could not be expected to say that we could
not work with them in France, though we could
in England, or that perhaps this girl would, and
that girl couldn't....</p>

<p>We naturally proceeded to act <i>en masse</i> as we
had acted individually, to do on a large scale
what had been done on a small, to manipulate
great bodies of women where before a few friends
had worked together. In every large body of persons
there are bound to be one or two individuals
who fail to come up to the required standard, but
that does not alter the principle that what can
safely be done in small quantities can safely be
done in large, provided the conditions are altered
to scale.</p>

<p>And that is what we are doing, and what our
Government is helping us to do; that is what our
Women's Army and our voluntary workers in
France are&mdash;the expression, on a large scale, of
what bands of women have been doing so successfully
on a small scale since the beginning of
the war&mdash;helping, and even replacing the men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
And just as, with our peculiar training and mode
of thought, it is possible for the average Englishwoman
to eliminate sex as a factor in the scheme
of things, so it is possible to eliminate it in greater
masses. In other words, it is perfectly possible,
to men and girls brought up with the English
method of free friendly intercourse, to work side
by side, to meet, to walk together, and to remain&mdash;merely
friends. Whether that is a good thing
or not is another point altogether, as it is whether
it makes for charm in a woman.... Certainly
no woman in this world competes with a Frenchwoman
for charm. It is as recognised as an Englishwoman's
complexion&mdash;and considerably more
lasting!</p>

<p>Probably it is only ourselves and the Americans
among the races of the world who could have
instituted such an experiment as that of our Women's
Army, but there is among the nations one
which is supreme in "flair," in sympathy, and a
certain ability to comprehend intellectually what
it might not understand emotionally, and that nation
is France.</p>

<p>I am confident that it will never have to be said
that when Englishwomen sacrificed so much&mdash;and
to a Frenchwoman one does not need to point
out what a sacrifice it is when a woman risks youth
and looks in hard unceasing work&mdash;that Frenchwomen
failed to understand them or to attribute
motives to them other than those that have animated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
themselves in their own labours throughout
the war.</p>

<p>That it must sometimes look odd to them one
knows so well; how can it be otherwise? They
see the girls, khaki-clad, out walking without
"Tommies," hear the sounds of music and dancing
coming from the recreation huts, where the
girls are allowed to invite the men, and <i>vice versa</i>.
Yet, if you investigate, you will find out that they
are of an extraordinary simplicity, these girls and
men, in their intercourse, in their earnest dancing,
taught them by instructors from our Young Men's
Christian Association, inspired by nothing more
heady than lemonade, and chaperoned by the
women-officers, who have attained a mixture of
authority and motherly supervision over every individual
girl that reminds me of nothing so much
as the care, born of a sort of divine cunning, of a
very dear and clever Mother Superior at a convent
I once stayed at in France. For the interesting
point for both the French and ourselves to
note is that in the treatment of our Women's
Army in France we have taken a leaf out of their
book. We look after the girls with something
of that love and care which surrounds a girl in
France.</p>

<p>For many of the Women's Army are working
girls, who have never been guarded in their lives,
whose parents had probably, after the lower-class
English way, very little influence with them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
who, though good, honest, rough girls, were free
to roam the streets of their native towns with
their friends every evening once their work was
over. Now, for what is for many of them the
first time in their lives, they are being watched
and guarded in a manner that is more French
than English, and which I find admirable. As for
their walks, their friendships with men, the personal
observation of the acute French will show
them that it is merely our Anglo-Saxon way, and
the official statistics will prove to any doubters
how well both the girls and the men can be trusted
to behave themselves. We are a cold nation if
you like, but there it is&mdash;it has its excellences,
if not its charms.</p>

<p>So much for fundamental differences, which,
when intelligence and sympathy go out to meet
them, become merely points on which temperaments
agree to differ amicably, each giving its
meed of admiration to the other. And for minor
matters, little things of different customs only,
that nevertheless, occasionally, in the strain of
this war, ruffle even friends, I would say something
like this, which is in the hearts of us all....</p>

<p>France&mdash;dear lovely France, to so many of us
adored for many years, who has stood to us for
the romance of the world, we know that in many
things our ways are not your ways and never will
be, nor would we wish it otherwise. To each nation
her distinctiveness, or she loses her soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
But, when those ways of ours seem to you most
alien, say to yourself: "This is only England's
differing way of doing what we are doing, of fighting
for what we are fighting for&mdash;the saving of
the right to individualism, the right to be different...."
To gain that we are all having to become
alike, just as to win freedom we are having
for a time to give it up, and the great thing to remember
is that this terrible coherent community
life is being borne with only that eventually we
may all be free men once more. Let us, for all
time, differ in our own ways, rather than agree
in the German! But also let us, while differing,
understand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>NOTES AND QUERIES</h3>


<p>On my last evening I sat and thought about
the girls I had seen and known, in greater and less
degrees, in passing. And I saw them, not as unthinking
"sporting" young things, who were having
a great adventure, but as girls who were
steadily sticking to their jobs, often without enjoyment
save that of knowledge of good work
well done. And I thought of those prophets who
gloomily foretell that the women will never want
to drop into the background again&mdash;forgetful
of the fact that where a woman is is never a background
to herself. I smiled as I thought of the
eagerness with which these hard workers in mud
and snow and heat will start buying pretty clothes
again and going out to parties ... and I was
very thankful to know how unchangedly woman
they had all remained, in spite of the fact that they
had had the strength to lay the privileges and the
fun of being a woman aside for a time.</p>

<p>I remembered what the D. of T. had said to
me when we discussed the question of how the
girls would settle down when it was all over, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
how he had thought that even if they did not
marry all would be well, because they would have
had their adventure.... I remembered too how
that had seemed to me the correct answer at the
time. Then later, when that awful web of depression
caught me, and the horror of the school-girl
conditions of life and all the apparent
"brightness" had choked me, I had all the more
thought it true, but marvelled; later still, when
I caught glimpses of that wonderful spirit and
that deep sophistication which had so cheered me,
I reversed the whole judgment and thought there
was nothing in it.</p>

<p>Now, thinking it all over, it seemed to me that
somewhere midway lay Truth. These girls have
had, in a certain sense, their adventure, but when
it is all over, they will have a reaction from it,
and I believe that reaction will be pleasant to
them, that it will be the reaction, and not the
memory of adventure, which will content them.
It is certain that to anyone who has worked as
these girls work a considerable period of doing
nothing in particular will be very acceptable.
They will all have to become themselves again,
which will be interesting....</p>

<p>Dear, wonderful girls ... you who wash
dishes and scrub and sweep, you girls of the
Women's Army who replace men and who do it
so thoroughly, you drivers who are out in all
weathers, night and day, sometimes for a week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or more on end, who face hardships such as
were faced in those three weeks at T&mdash;&mdash; when
there were no fires and no water, how glad I
am to have met you.... So I sat and thought,
and then I picked up a copy of <i>The Times</i> which
had just come over. And in the "Personal" column
this caught my eye:</p>

<p>"Lady wants war-work, preferably motor-driving,
from three to five p.m."</p>

<p>And I saw that it was not only those far removed
from the war who misunderstood both what
it demands and that which has arisen to meet
those demands.</p>

<p>Do we not nearly all fail to realise the magnitude
and import of what is being done by these
unspectacular workers behind the lines, who are
yet part of war itself, and daily and nightly
strengthen the hands of the fighters? Some of us
in England realise as little as you in far-off countries,
and yet it should be our business to know,
because the least we can do is to understand so
that we, in our much less fine way, can help them
a little, one tithe of the amount they help our
fighting men.</p>

<p>Not because of any desire of theirs for praise
is it necessary&mdash;I never saw a healthier disregard,
amounting to a kindly contempt, for what those
at home think or don't think, than among the
women working in France&mdash;but because it is only
by knowing that we can respond generously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
enough to the needs of their work, and only by
understanding that we can save our own souls
from that fat and contented ignorance which induces
a sleep uncommonly like death.</p>

<p>Nor, as long as we listen to the girls themselves,
are we in any danger of thinking too much of them
or of their work. Not a woman I met, English or
American, working in France, but said something
like this, and meant it: "What, after all, is anything
we can do, except inasmuch as it may help
the men a little? How could we bear to do nothing
when the men are doing the most wonderful
thing that has ever been done in the world?"</p>
